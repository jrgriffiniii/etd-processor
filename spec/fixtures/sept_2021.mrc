The first problem we tackle is known in the literature as the amplitude constrained Gaussian channel. It is well known that for a peak-power constrained Gaussian channel the capacity-achieving input distribution is discrete with finitely many mass points. However, an unfortunate shortcoming of the prior proof technique, a bound on the number of mass points in the capacity-achieving input distribution was not accessible previously. Here, we provide an alternative proof of the finiteness of the number of mass points of the capacity-achieving input distribution while producing the first firm upper bound on the number of mass points. We also generalize this novel proof technique to multi-dimensional settings as well as to the amplitude constrained Gaussian mean estimation problem. The second problem we resolve is in the realm of channel resolvability and error exponents. Using simple but non-trivial techniques, we establish the exact exponents for the soft-covering phenomenon of a memoryless channel under the total variation metric when random i.i.d. and random constant-composition channel codes are used. Moreover, we provide alternative representations of these exponents in terms of α-mutual information, relating the two seemingly unrelated mathematical concepts in a very pleasing manner. Lastly, we turn our attention to universal lossless compression. We characterize the redundancy for universal lossless compression of discrete memoryless sources in Campbell's setting as a minimax Renyi divergence, which we show to be equal to the maximal α-mutual information via a generalized redundancy-capacity theorem. We place particular emphasis on the analysis of the asymptotics of minimax Renyi divergence, which we determine up to a term vanishing in blocklength, building a bridge between the asymptotics of minimax regret and minimax redundancy.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aComputer science. 4aComputer engineering. 4aInformation science.  aChannel capacity  aData science  aError exponents  aParameter estimation  aPrivate communication  aUniversal lossless compression  a0984  a0464  a072320aPrinceton University.bElectrical Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2849045603961nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001700131245009600148260005800244300001100302500007800313500002500391502004800416506005900464520244400523590002302967650002502990650002203015653003203037653001803069653003803087653002103125653003503146653003303181690000903214690000903223710006603232773005103298790000903349791001003358792000903368793001203377856015003389AAI2849862520220920004305.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106413  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28498625  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aBao, Ruying.10aTowards Robust Models in Deep Learning: Regularizing Neural Networks and Generative Models. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a118 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: E., Weinan.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aDeep neural networks are widely used in signal processing from a broad range of areas due to their good performances, including computer vision, natural language processing, automatic driving, and so on. However, people notice that neural networks are easily fooled by adversarial attacks and very sensitive to certain data-related scenarios, such as imbalanced classes and outliers. In this thesis, we focus on enhancing model robustness of deep neural networks from different data distributions.In the first part, we focus on datasets whose distributions are biased naturally, from data collection or the nature of data. We define novel information-entropy-based classification loss functions (entropy weight and entropy noise) to distinguish the difficulty of each sample prediction by either weighting or introducing stochastic noise on top of the cross entropy loss. To evaluate the effectiveness of each loss function, we test the new loss functions on crafted noisy and imbalanced datasets based on MNIST. To illustrate their effectiveness in real scenarios, we show improvements on tasks including computer vision and natural language understanding, compared to the corresponding state of the art (SOTA) models. The results show that models trained with entropy-based loss functions surpass the SOTA models.Deep neural networks have also been demonstrated to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small perturbations intentionally added to the original inputs can fool the classifier. In the second part, we propose Path-Norm regularization to improve robustness of neural networks against adversarial attacks in various Lp norms. By adding Path-Norm regularization, models achieve comparable performance as the SOTA defense methods, and outperform SOTA methods when attacks and training samples are from different Lp spaces. We also introduce Featurized Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (FBGAN), which extracts semantic features of inputs and filters the non-semantic perturbations. FBGAN is pre-trained on clean datasets in an unsupervised manner, adversarially learning a bidirectional mapping between the high-dimensional data space and the low-dimensional semantic space. After the bidirectional mapping, the adversarial data can be reconstructed to denoised data, which could be fed into any pre-trained classifier. We empirically show the quality of reconstruction images and the effectiveness of defense.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aApplied mathematics. 4aComputer science.  aAdversarial defense methods  aDeep learning  aEntropy-based objective functions  aGenerative model  aReconstructive defense methods  aRegularizing neural networks  a0364  a098420aPrinceton University.bApplied and Computational Mathematics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2849862503588nam a2200373   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001800131245010300149260005800252300001000310500007800320500003500398502004800433506005900481520227000540590002302810650003002833650001302863653002502876653001802901690000902919690000902928710003602937773005102973790000903024791001003033792000903043793001203052856015003064AAI2849919720220920004306.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460484607  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28499197  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aZhang, Junyi.10aStudy of Phases of Matter: Dipolar Dimer Liquid and Topological Metamaterials with Odd Elasticity. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a81 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Haldane, F.

Simple physics principles are proposed to categorise various phases of matter. The physical principles are often exemplified by simple idealised models. When they are applied to more complicated biochemical systems, some generalisations may be needed.In this thesis, two idealised models, dipolar dimer liquid and topological metamaterials with odd elasticity, are discussed. The first model, Dipolar Dimer Liquid (DDL), is motivated by water. It is a simplified model consisting of dipolar dimers on lattice with a Coulombic interaction between the dimers. The Coulombic interaction is an idealised model for the hydrogen bond interaction. It is found that there exists a liquid-liquid phase transition in this model. To understand this phase transition, an exact mapping from the DDL to the annealed Ising model on random graphs has been constructed. Consequently, one may identify the order parameter charactering the liquid-liquid phase transition of the DDL with the order parameter, magnetisation, of the Ising model. One may further bound the critical temperature with the help of this exact mapping and the exactly solved Ising models in 2D. The estimation of the critical temperature has been confirmed by the numerical simulations. A quantum generalisation of the DDL has also been proposed. Interesting interplay of the Coulombic interaction and the quantum solid-liquid transition is discussed.The second model is motivated by active matters. In the presence of active energy pumping, a strange stress response, the odd elasticity, is admissible. In our model, the odd elasticity comes from an idealised model of metabeams, and the dynamics of the system becomes non-Hermitian. Interestingly, the topological properties still survive in the non-Hermitian dynamics. But the bulk modes also become exponentially localised, which is called non-Hermitian skin effect. To characterise the topological properties, the definition of the Brillouin zone has been generalised, and the definition of the Zak-Berry phase has been clarified for the non-Hermitian systems. 1D rotor chain and 2D rotor lattice have been discussed in detail as demonstrating examples.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aCondensed matter physics. 4aPhysics.  aDipolar dimer liquid  aNon-Hermitian  a0611  a060520aPrinceton University.bPhysics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2849919703060nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001500131245012100146260005800267300001100325500007800336500002900414502004800443506005900491520164700550590002302197650002802220650001202248650002302260653000902283653001302292653002602305690000902331690000902340690000902349710005102358773005102409790000902460791001002469792000902479793001202488856015002500AAI2854000720220920004306.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106444  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28540007  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLyu, Ming.10aSoftware Design for Modeling Quantum Cascade Lasers and Long Wavelength (~16μm) GaAs/AlGaAs Quantum Cascade Lasers. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a155 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Gmachl, Claire.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis thesis reviews the modeling techniques for mid-infrared quantum cascade lasers based on III/V materials, clarifies or corrects ambiguity concepts such as state-dependent effective mass, the non-parabolic kinetic energy and its modeling, and the polarized waveguide confinement in the mathematical perturbation sense. These models are summarized with consistent notation and provide a solid background for developing new quantum cascade devices.The theory is integrated into our work on developing user-friendly software for designing and modeling quantum cascade lasers. We utilize state-of-the-art open-source platforms to construct a development environment that will keep the software both scientifically correct and software engineeringly maintainable. The software performance and the numerical error are also analyzed in this work.Experimentally we present a new 16μm GaAs/AlGaAs quantum cascade laser design with bound-to-bound transition andstrongly coupled upper and injection states. For the waveguide, we propose to utilize AlxGa1-xAs layers of high Al concentration (x=70%) for the cladding layer, which strongly reduces the waveguide loss compared to previous attempts with high-doped GaAs.With the experimental demonstration, we summarize our work on developing fabrication recipes for GaAs-based quantum cascade lasers and the measurement platform for long-wavelength infrared optics.The new design is shown to have a threshold current density smaller than the record of GaAs/AlGaAs-based quantum cascade lasers of similar wavelength --- an improvement by 50% --- and the spectrum matches exactly the designed wavelength.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aElectrical engineering. 4aOptics. 4aMaterials science.  aGaAs  aInfrared  aQuantum cascade laser  a0544  a0752  a079420aPrinceton University.bElectrical Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854000703231nam a2200385   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002400131245005500155260005800210300001100268500007800279500002900357502004800386506005900434520192100493590002302414650001302437653002402450653002702474653001502501653002502516653001802541690000902559710003602568773005102604790000902655791001002664792000902674793001202683856015002695AAI2854018820220920004306.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106123  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28540188  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aBinder, Damon John.10aOn \uD835\uDCA9 = 6 Superconformal Field Theories. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a209 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Pufu, Silviu S.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aIn this thesis we study \uD835\uDCA9 = 6 superconformal field theories (SCFTs) in three dimensions. Such theories are highly constrained by supersymmetry, allowing many quantities to be computed exactly. Yet though constrained, \uD835\uDCA9 = 6 SCFTs still exhibit a rich array of behaviors, and in various regimes can be dual holographically to M-theory on AdS4xS7, IIA string theory on AdS4x ℂℙ3, and higherspin gravity on AdS4. We will use tools from conformal bootstrap and supersymmetric localization to study \uD835\uDCA9 = 6 theories, both in general and in holographic regimes.We begin in Chapter 2 by deriving the supersymmetric Ward identities and the superconformal block expansion for the four-point correlator ⟨SSSS⟩ of stress tensor multiplet scalars S. Chapter 3 then studies the mass-deformed sphere partition function, which can be computed exactly using supersymmetric localization, and relates derivatives of this quantity to specific integrals of ⟨SSSS⟩.In Chapter 4 we study the IIA string and M-theory limits of the ABJ family of \uD835\uDCA9 = 6 SCFTs. Using the supersymmetric Ward identities and localization results, we are able to fully determine the R4 corrections to the ⟨SSSS⟩ correlator in both limits. By taking the flat space limit, we can compare to the known R4 contribution to the IIA and M-theory S-matrix, allowing us to perform a check of AdS/CFT at finite string coupling.In Chapter 5 we study the higher-spin limit of \uD835\uDCA9 = 6 theories. Using the weakly broken higherspin Ward identity, we completely determine the leading correction to ⟨SSSS⟩ in this limit up to two free parameters, which for ABJ theory we then fix using localization. Finally, in Chapter 6 we perform the first numerical bootstrap study of \uD835\uDCA9 = 6 superconformal field theories, allowing us to derive non-perturbative bounds on the CFT data contributing to ⟨SSSS⟩.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPhysics.  aConformal bootstrap  aConformal field theory  aHolography  aQuantum field theory  aSupersymmetry  a060520aPrinceton University.bPhysics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854018803698nam a2200493   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001900131245003400150260005800184300001100242500007800253500003100331502004800362506006900410506005900479520214400538590002302682650001702705650002302722650001902745650001702764653001302781653000802794653001502802653001602817653001202833653001302845653002102858690000902879690000902888690000902897690000902906710004802915773005102963790000903014791001003023792000903033793001203042856015003054AAI2854040920220920004306.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460484522  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28540409  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aPartman, Lucy.10aWilliam Rimmer: Teaching Art. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a231 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Delue, Rachael Z.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aRarely do we find an artist, physician, and educator all in the same person. Yet this describes William Rimmer (1816–1879). He doesn’t fit into common historical narratives and can’t be contained in a single discipline. Scholarship since his death has largely focused on and interprets his work through the lens of his enigmatic personality and family history. Yet accounts of Rimmer during his lifetime tell other, even more compelling stories. Newspapers were fascinated with the unique combination of science and imagination found in his art. Many were mesmerized by what and how he taught at places such as the Lowell Institute in Massachusetts and the Female School of Design at Cooper Union in New York. Aside from the artists who came from around the country, all types of people attended Rimmer’s classes and lectures on what he called “Art Anatomy.” The majority of his students were women, who were, like Rimmer, acknowledged for their work during the period, but have remained largely absent from our histories.Through Rimmer, we gain insight into nineteenth-century art, science, and education, and more specifically the professionalization of women artists, public lecturing, and performance culture, to cite just a few examples. Foregrounding his teaching, this project seeks to reveal Rimmer at the center of a complex and extensive network of individuals, institutions, and ideas. Rimmer is part of two “lineages” not often discussed in histories of nineteenth-century American art: that of artist-educators and artists for whom the body was central to their expression and their primary medium of meaning making and theory production. Looking closely at Rimmer allows us to reconsider and expand established stories of American art, education, and history.This dissertation proposes that Rimmer’s art and teaching were intimately intertwined. In both, Rimmer emphasized the importance of guiding and engaging the participant and leaving space for her own imagination, experiences, and questions. Looking closely at Rimmer’s approaches and philosophy can help us reimagine the role of art and educators.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aArt history. 4aEducation history. 4aArt education. 4aBiographies.  aAmerican  aArt  aBlackboard  aPerformance  aScience  aTeaching  aRimmer, William   a0377  a0520  a0304  a027320aPrinceton University.bArt and Archaeology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854040903151nam a2200373   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002200131245008200153260005800235300001100293500007800304500003500382502004800417506006900465506005900534520174500593590002302338650002302361653003202384653004502416653002802461690000902489710003802498773005102536790000902587791001002596792000902606793001202615856015002627AAI2854055320220920004307.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106260  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28540553  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aTill, Nicholas A.10aReaction Development and Mechanistic Analysis in Nickel/Photoredox Catalysis. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a390 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: MacMillan, David W.C.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aTransition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling has had a significant impact onpharmaceutical, agrochemical, and materials science research. This broad class of synthetic reactions has dramatically streamlined the synthesis of molecules at the center of research in these areas and others. The development of cross-coupling reactions for such applications continues to occupy a central role in the synthetic organic chemistry community. The advent of photoredox catalysis and its merger with transition metal catalysis has further elevated this broader reaction platform by expanding the scope of accessible bond-forming and bond-breaking events. These advances in cross-coupling technology have seen widespread adoption in academic and industrial settings, but we are just beginning to understand how these processes function on a mechanistic level.This thesis describes the discovery of new reactivity within the broader context of nickel/photoredox dual-catalysis as well as studies into the mechanisms underlying multiple cross-coupling reactions within this regime. Chapter 2 details the discovery of a stereoselective approach to alkyne radical addition using carboxylic acids to effect an overall alkyne hydroalkylation process. In chapter 3, a nickel C–O reductive elimination process is studied in detail using transient absorption spectroscopy and stoichiometric organometallic experiments. Chapter 4 covers the use of multiple spectroscopic, kinetic, and organometallic studies to uncover the mechanism of a Ni/photoredox aryl amination reaction. Finally, the use of pulse radiolysis and spectroelectrochemistry to generate and study short-lived Ni(I) intermediates relevant to Ni/photoredox cross-coupling is disclosed in chapter 5.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aOrganic chemistry.  aNickel/photoredox catalysis  aNickel C-O reductive elimination process  aSpectroelectrochemistry  a049020aPrinceton University.bChemistry.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854055304136nam a2200385   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001700131245008200148260005800230300001100288500007800299500003000377502004800407506005900455520278400514590002303298650002803321653001703349653002303366653002003389653002103409653001903430690000903449710005103458773005103509790000903560791001003569792000903579793001203588856015003600AAI2854074620220920004307.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460484584  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28540746  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLiu, Yushan.10aEnhancing Network Security and Privacy Using Graph-Theoretic Characteristics. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a144 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Mittal, Prateek.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aToday, governments, businesses, and the critical infrastructure are facing cyberattacks of increasing frequency, intensity, and complexity. With the widespread use of sensitive data in applications such as social network based systems and enterprise systems, the chances of breaching the privacy of individuals and corporations have increased. It has thus become essential to protect networks and data from security threats and privacy leakage. Towards this end, an important line of research has focused on enhancing security and privacy using the analysis of graphs, such as social graphs in reputation systems and anonymous communication systems, and causal dependency graphs in enterprise forensic systems.In this thesis, we explore solutions to the limitations of two widely adopted graph analytics techniques in security and privacy applications, i.e., analysis of trust relationships in social graphs and causal relationships in dependency graphs. We observe that classical paradigms for graph analytics, such as the use of random walks on social graphs and the use of breadth-first search on dependency graphs, have induced poor trade-offs between security/privacy and functionality due to the lack of flexibility. Our insight is that leveraging graph-theoretic characteristics and machine learning techniques, we can make the conventional paradigms adaptive to improve the security/privacy without harming the utility.We present three systems for network security and privacy based on our advanced graph analytics: i) we introduce an adaptive random walk algorithm that uses a heterogeneous random walk length across nodes in a graph based on their local structural characteristics. Based on this algorithm, we propose SmartWalk, a security enhancing system which incorporates adaptive random walks in social network security applications. ii) We introduce a prioritized search algorithm that considers the topological properties of nodes in a graph to accelerate the search. Based on this algorithm, we propose PrioTracker, a backward and forward causality tracker that automatically prioritizes the search for abnormal causal dependencies within a time constraint. iii) We introduce an interruptible context-based prioritized search algorithm that propagates and re-assesses node priorities by uncovering the paths between nodes on a graph. Based on this algorithm, we propose RAPID, an automated real-time alert triage system that helps scale up the alarm processing capability in enterprises. Using multiple real-world datasets, we show that these three systems are able to improve the trade-off between security/privacy and utility by at least one order of magnitude. Two of our proposed systems, PrioTracker and RAPID, have been deployed in real-world enterprises.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aElectrical engineering.  aData privacy  aEnterprise network  aGraph analytics  aNetwork security  aSocial network  a054420aPrinceton University.bElectrical Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854074603102nam a2200385   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001800131245005800149260005800207300001100265500007800276500003600354502004800390506005900438520181800497590002302315650001502338653001402353653001102367653001502378653001402393653002102407690000902428710003802437773005102475790000902526791001002535792000902545793001202554856015002566AAI2854117520220920004307.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460484638  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28541175  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aPerry, Ian B.10aSynthesis and Diversification of Csp3-rich Scaffolds. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a174 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: MacMillan, David W.

Recently, as studies have emphasized the importance of three-dimensionality in drug discovery, there has been revitalized interest in the installation of sp3-hybridized fragments. Transition metal catalysis, distinguished in its capacity to seamlessly forge bonds between otherwise unreactive reactants, has been somewhat lackluster in the context of constructing three-dimensional frameworks between sp3-hybridized centers. The early focus of transition metal catalysis on arene and alkene functionalization, coupled with problematic B-hydride elimination from palladium, have caused a disparity in the chemical space accessible by cross-coupling. The merger of photoredox catalysis with metal catalysis has been largely successful in incorporating novel sp3-hybridized scaffolds into the realm of cross coupling over the last decade. Metal catalysts can sequester organic radicals from solution, generating transient organometallic intermediates from readily available functional groups such as carboxylic acids, alcohols, and activated C–H bonds. This has served to both expand the pool of available sp3-rich precursors as well as advance novel disconnections not possible by thermal activation modes. Herein are described applications of this platform toward the synthesis and diversification of sp3 fragments. Chapter 2 details the direct cross-coupling of strong C–H bond-bearing aliphatic frameworks with aryl electrophiles via nickel catalysis. Chapter 3 discloses the synthesis of a novel cubane carboxylic acids, and their subsequent engagement in a variety of decarboxylative coupling protocols catalyzed by copper.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aChemistry.  aCatalysis  aCubane  aPhotoredox  aSynthesis  aTransition metal  a048520aPrinceton University.bChemistry.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854117503397nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002500131245009100156260005800247300001100305500007800316500003300394502004800427506005900475520194100534590002302475650002702498650002202525650001902547653001502566653003602581653002502617653001902642690000902661690000902670690000902679710004602688773005102734790000902785791001002794792000902804793001202813856015002825AAI2854126520220920004308.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460484683  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28541265  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aAlizzi, Rebecca Ann.10aElucidating the Role of RNA-Binding Proteins in Drosophila Sensory Neuron Development. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a127 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Gavis, Elizabeth R.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aNeurons are a diverse group of cells, with their unique morphology often linked to specific functional requirements. The intricate morphology of neurons necessitates a multilayered developmental process, with regulation occurring at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational levels. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that mediate post-transcriptional regulation can function at all stages of the lifecycle of a transcript, allowing for rapid and localized control over gene expression. These regulatory features are particularly important in cells as expansive and morphologically complex as neurons. The Drosophila larval class IV dendritic arborization (da) neurons provide an ideal system for studying the role of RBPs in neuron development. These highly branched sensory neurons completely and non-redundantly tile the larval body wall. Here, we analyze the role of the RBP Found in neurons (Fne) in regulating the space-filling dendrite growth that is characteristic of these neurons. Our results indicate that Fne regulates multiple transcripts and in doing so, is able to modulate both processes intrinsic to the neuron as well as interactions between the neuron and the surrounding environment. By regulating multiple, functionally-related transcripts in tandem, Fne is able to act as a central coordinator of neuronal morphology. This synchronized regulation is likely to be an important feature of many other RBPs that have been implicated in neuronal morphogenesis. Furthermore, our results reveal that the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of Fne in class IV da neurons are distinct from its recently revealed functions in the central nervous system. The differences in Fne function in various types of neurons, and therefore its participation in distinct regulatory processes, could be a feature that is common to many RBPs and may contribute to the vast morphological diversity observed in neurons.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aDevelopmental biology. 4aCellular biology. 4aNeurosciences.  aDrosophila  aPost-transcriptional regulation  aRNA-binding proteins  aSensory neuron  a0758  a0379  a031720aPrinceton University.bMolecular Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854126504407nam a2200457   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002000131245007700151260005800228300001100286500007800297500003600375502004800411506006900459506005900528520283000587590002303417650002303440650001803463650001803481653002403499653002503523653002503548653001403573653003103587653002503618690000903643690000903652690000903661710003803670773005103708790000903759791001003768792000903778793001203787856015003799AAI2854166520220920004308.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106932  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28541665  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aBacauanu, Vlad.10aPhotocatalytic Methodology for Fluoroalkylation and Peptide Cyclization. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a407 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: MacMillan, David W.

The strong redox properties of photocatalysts enable oxidation and reduction of generally unreactive functional groups, converting organic substrates to radical intermediates that can be engaged in useful and otherwise challenging reactivity manifolds. As such, photoredox has been established as a powerful platform for accessing and diversifying complex molecular architectures under mild conditions. Metallaphotoredox, the merger of photoredox with transition metal catalysis, has further expanded chemists’ synthetic toolbox and enabled difficult bond disconnections via metal-catalyzed radical cross-coupling and light-facilitated elementary organometallic steps. Additionally, due to its mildness and biocompatibility, photoredox has found novel applications in biorelevant contexts, such as protein functionalization and peptide macrocyclization.New technologies for the selective installation of fluorinated moieties into organic molecules are highly sought after in drug discovery due to the pharmacological benefits of fluorine incorporation, yet are typically challenging to develop. Chapters 2 and 3 demonstrate the potential of metallaphotoredox to enable novel polyfluoroalkylation platforms.In particular, Chapter 2 describes a nickel/photoredox-catalyzed protocol for (hetero)aryl bromide difluoromethylation. Silyl radical-mediated halogen atom abstraction renders bromodifluoromethane a convenient difluoromethylating agent, with broad arene and heteroarene scope. A notable correlation between optimal reagent stoichiometry and substrate electronic character is discussed. Chapter 3 details the first merger of decatungstate photocatalysis with copper catalysis, enabling a general aliphatic C(sp3)–H trifluoromethylation platform. Abundant feedstocks, natural products, and pharmaceuticals are site-selectively trifluoromethylated, with high tolerance for traditionally challenging polar functional groups. Mechanistic studies provide insight into the role of the copper catalyst, a finding with significant implications for the growing field of iodonium-based copper-mediated trifluoromethylation.Macrocyclic peptides are an established class of therapeutics with unique properties, but the scale-up and validation of these promising structure remains a bottleneck in the drug discovery process. Chapter 4 describes ongoing development of a photocatalytic technology for the streamlined synthesis of thioether-linked peptides via tandem solid-support release/cyclization. The platform relies on the use of light-enabled spin-center shift for mild cleavage from solid supports, made possible by implementing a phenyl ketone linker compatible with automated solid-phase synthesis.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aOrganic chemistry. 4aPharmacology. 4aBiochemistry.  aDifluoromethylation  aMacrocyclic peptides  aPhotoredox catalysis  aSynthesis  aTransition metal catalysis  aTrifluoromethylation  a0490  a0487  a041920aPrinceton University.bChemistry.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854166503609nam a2200433   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100003300131245006400164260005800228300001100286500007800297500003200375502004800407506005900455520218800514590002302702650001202725650002102737650002002758653001602778653000802794653001902802653001102821653001002832690000902842690000902851690000902860710006502869773005102934790000902985791001002994792000903004793001203013856015003025AAI2854215820220920004308.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460484645  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28542158  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aNew-Tolley, Matthew Raymond.10aModeling Laser-Gas Interactions for Aerospace Applications. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a165 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Shneider, Mikhail.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aIn certain circumstances, laser pulses can propagate kilometers through atmospheric gases relatively untouched. In other conditions, the propagation distances are measured in centimeters and large amounts of laser energy are deposited into the gas resulting in blast waves and plasma regions. This thesis explores the modeling of laser-gas interactions across this spectrum of length scales and intensities. In kilometer scale atmospheric laser propagation, large scale density gradients result in beam deflection. These deflections were studied using a ray tracing algorithm in a look-down LiDAR system to analyze the resulting altitude errors. The altitude errors generated from thermal plumes, atmospheric ducts and vehicle shock waves are also investigated. If the peak intensity of the pulse is increased such that the beam can generate localized breakdown, we can couple significant amounts of laser energy into the gas. For femtosecond laser pulses, this highly localized energy deposition can be considered instantaneous. The rapid temperature and pressure increase generates a set of radially expanding blast waves. We show that the dynamics of these blast waves can be described by quasi-similarity theory using a Navier-Stokes solver with a novel flux correction technique. By analyzing the motion of these weak blast waves in experimental data we can calculate the energy deposited into the gas during the laser breakdown process. The radial dynamics of low density ‘hot channels’ which form along the laser axis and the gas parameters along this laser axis are also characterized. When the pulse length is on the order of nanoseconds, the plasma chemistry can no longer be neglected as the plasma generated in the first half of the laser pulse dramatically affects the propagation of the latter portions of the pulse. Using an integrated chemical-optical solver to track energy deposition from single and dual nanosecond laser pulses, we show that self-defocusing results in a biased growth of the plasma region towards the focusing lens. We also show that this defocusing effect can be harnessed for use in a novel laser machining technique we call Dynamic Masking.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aOptics. 4aFluid mechanics. 4aPlasma physics.  aBlast waves  aCFD  aLaser ignition  aLasers  aLiDAR  a0752  a0204  a075920aPrinceton University.bMechanical and Aerospace Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854215803678nam a2200433   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001900131245008600150260005800236300001100294500007800305500002400383502004800407506005900455520029900514520063200813520129601445590002302741650002502764650002202789650002902811653002502840653002002865653002502885690000902910690000902919690000902928710006602937773005103003790000903054791001003063792000903073793001203082856015003094AAI2854223020220920004308.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106338  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28542230  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aWang, Qingcan.10aSelected Topics in Deep Learning Theory and Continuous-Time Hidden Markov Models. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a135 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: E, Weinan.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe first part of the thesis proves some theoretical results in deep learning.

We also develop a general method to show that the deep networks never have worse approximation properties than shallow ones. For the optimization problem, we analyze the global convergence of gradient descent for deep linear residual networks by proposing a new initialization: zero-asymmetric (ZAS) initialization. It is motivated by avoiding stable manifolds of saddle points. We prove that under the ZAS initialization, for an arbitrary target matrix, gradient descent converges to an epsilon-optimal point in O(L.  a3 log 1/epsilon) iterations, which scales polynomially with the network depth L. It demonstrates the importance of the residual structure and the initialization in the optimization for deep linear neural networks. The second part focuses on continuous-time hidden Markov models (CT-HMM), where both the hidden states and observations occur in continuous time. We propose a unified framework that formally obtains the model parameter estimation by taking continuous-time limit of the classical discrete-time Baum-Welch algorithm, and recovers and extends several previous results in CT-HMM under different settings. Here two settings are illustrated: hidden jump process with a finite state space, and hidden diffusion process with a continuous state space. For each setting, we first estimate the hidden state given the observations and model parameters, showing that the posterior distribution of the hidden states can be described by differential equations in continuous time. Then we consider the estimation of unknown model parameters, deriving the continuous-time formulas for the expectation-maximization algorithm. We also propose a Monte Carlo method based on the continuous formulation, sampling the posterior distribution of the hidden states and updating the parameter estimation.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aApplied mathematics. 4aComputer science. 4aArtificial intelligence.  aDeep learning theory  aContinuous time  aHidden Markov models  a0364  a0984  a080020aPrinceton University.bApplied and Computational Mathematics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854223004079nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002400131245007600155260005800231300001100289500007800300500003000378502004800408506005900456520270500515590002303220650002303243650001403266653002203280653002203302653002603324653001203350653001103362690000903373690000903382710003703391773005103428790000903479791001003488792000903498793001203507856015003519AAI2854224420220920004309.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460484492  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28542244  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMayorga, Alexandra.10aHostile Contexts and the Consequences for Muslim Political Integration. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a174 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Valenzuela, Ali.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aMuslim immigrant-minority (MIM) communities are projected to become critical proportions of European electorates in the next few decades. Yet at the same time, MIMs are frequently the targets of aggressive and antagonistic political campaigns and rhetoric. These two trends beg the question, how might hostile contexts shape MIMs’ political incorporation outcomes? So far, research on hostility’s effects among European immigrant-minority populations is still in its infancy, with even less evidence to identify whether hostility produces clear responses among targeted group members. In my own project, I create and implement an original survey experiment (N = 1000) in the United Kingdom to test for and ultimately establish the existence of a causal relationship. Instead of assuming uniform responses, the project further adopts an approach that accounts for important moderating variables (Muslim identification, partisan attachment). The project focuses on three outcomes of interest: vote likelihood, vote choice, and organizational involvement.In the first section, I find that exposure to hostile cues increases likelihood of voting overall and particularly among the specific subgroups of interest (strong Muslim identifiers and politically marginalized MIMs). In the second section, I examine whether intent to vote for the Labour Party (the largest and most viable option) increases in response to evidence of group-targeted threat. I find that hostility (relative to the control) increases preference for Labour both in the aggregate and among the specific subgroups of interest. In the final section, I look beyond behaviors that involve direct interaction with political institutions to consider more communal, organizational involvement. Here I also distinguish between in-group-oriented and mainstream organizations to identify whether differences in organizational orientation shape involvement interest. I find that while hostility does not increase aggregate involvement interest, more politically integrated MIMs (partisans) are mobilized by hostility, while the opposite is true for more politically marginalized MIMs.Together these findings suggest that though MIMs are stigmatized and marginalized, hostile messages can serve to mobilize participation and engagement to produce more pro-group outcomes. In general, I do not find evidence that group-targeted and politically sourced hostility diminishes MIM interest in integrating and participating in their community. These results have important implications for political integration trajectories of MIM communities and marginalized communities more generally as they work to find their voices in contemporary politics.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPolitical science. 4aReligion.  aEuropean politics  aIdentity politics  aImmigrant integration  aMuslims  aSurvey  a0615  a031820aPrinceton University.bPolitics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854224403595nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001700131245002900148260005800177300001100235500007800246500003300324502004800357506006900405506005900474520221700533590002302750650002302773653002202796653001002818653001402828653001402842653001302856653000802869690000902877690000902886710003702895773005102932790000902983791001002992792000903002793001203011856015003023AAI2854224920220920004309.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106758  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28542249  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aReich, Noam.10aHow Do States Negotiate? 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a168 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Ramsay, Kristopher.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation is comprised of three separate essays. The first two explore how states cope with uncertainty in international crises that can lead to war. The third essay studies gang conflict.In "Signaling Strength with Handicaps", I introduce a novel class of signals for communicating strength. I argue that states can signal strength by handicapping themselves, deliberately reducing their combat effectiveness. In an ultimatum crisis bargaining model, I show that strong states can use handicaps to reduce the risk of war. The key to this result is a comparative advantage that allows stronger types to fight more effectively with handicaps. This allows for an equilibrium where (1) stronger states adopt larger handicaps, (2) larger handicaps are more likely to deter the receiver, and (3) the positive risk of war precludes weaker types from imitating the handicap signal.In "Dynamic Screening in International Crises", I argue that the amount of time and effort that states invest in diplomacy is a function of their resolve. A state that finds war an attractive option will escalate the crisis earlier. By contrast, a state that considers the threat of war to be particularly detrimental will accept less risk and concede before their rival can declare war. Modeling a crisis as a war of attrition, I show that the amount of delay that a state is willing to tolerate in a crisis serves as a key source of information about its resolve. This presents a powerful alternative to conventional signaling models and generates divergent predictions about states' behavior.In "Gunshots and Turf Wars: Inferring Gang Territories from Administrative Data" (joint with Brendan Cooley), we study street gangs. Though conjectured to engage in territorial conflict, the covert nature makes them difficult to study. The number of gangs operating in a city and the division of territory between them are unobserved. We develop a method that exploits spatial patterns in violence to recover these parameters. We apply our method to study gang competition in Chicago using victim-based crime reports from the Chicago Police Department (CPD) and validate our methodology using gang territorial maps produced by the CPD.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPolitical science.  aCrisis bargaining  aGangs  aScreening  aSignaling  aViolence  aWar  a0615  a060120aPrinceton University.bPolitics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854224903949nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002400131245008100155260005800236300001100294500007800305500002900383502004800412506006900460506005900529506006700588520236800655590002303023650001703046650002803063653001703091653002203108653001803130653001803148653002003166653001003186690000903196690000903205710004803214773005103262790000903313791001003322792000903332793001203341856015003353AAI2854236120220920004309.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486182  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28542361  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMurphy, Benjamin O.10aSecond-Order Images: Reflexive Strategies in Early Latin American Video Art. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a342 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Small, Irene V.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis dissertation investigates the emergence of video as an artistic medium among a group of artists and institutions from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Uruguay during the 1970s. The project’s four chapters focus on how these diverse actors used video to adopt, engage, and critique the research methods of the social sciences, employing the novel recording technology to conduct surveys, ethnographic fieldwork, and other forms of social documentation and data collection. I place these experiments in dialogue with contemporaneous developments within Latin American sociology, anthropology, communication studies, and political science. In so doing, I interpret how video art intervened within key questions animating social analysis in Latin America during the period, namely the region’s economic dependency under U.S. hegemony, and the rise of new forms of authoritarianism and their relation to emergent systems of mass media. Through this focus, the dissertation enriches our understanding of the relationship between art and politics within the context of the South American dictatorships of the 1970s. Video, I argue, not only furnished artists with strategies for expressing and acting upon these political circumstances; it also served as a platform for reflexive questions about how politics could be represented, and about whether such representational practices might in turn perform political functions of their own. Early Latin American video art was thus aligned with a growing postwar movement across the social sciences toward a paradigm of second-order observation, a position from which those sciences began to take their own instruments, postulates, and histories as primary objects of their own analyses. Bringing this reflexivity to bear upon the concept of Latin America itself, the artists I study offered a critical view of how that geopolitical category was constructed by the sciences that purported to observe it. Furthermore, they suggested how the category could be reconfigured for purposes of political solidarity through subversive strategies of recording and broadcast. The dissertation thus de-naturalizes the concept of Latin American art as a given disciplinary subfield, focusing instead on how artistic practice served as a key arena within which the construct of Latin America was scrutinized and contested.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aArt history. 4aLatin American history.  aDictatorship  aInterdisciplinary  aLatin America  aMedia studies  aSocial sciences  aVideo  a0377  a033620aPrinceton University.bArt and Archaeology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854236104265nam a2200469   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002700131245011100158260005800269300001100327500007800338500002700416502004800443506006900491506005900560520268300619590002303302650003203325650002303357650002203380653001403402653001003416653001203426653001003438653001103448653001503459653001703474690000903491690000903500690000903509710003603518773005103554790000903605791001003614792000903624793001203633856015003645AAI2854271220220920004309.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460485994  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28542712  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aClayton, James Thomas.14aThe Reformation of Indifference: Adiaphora, Toleration, and English Literature in the Seventeenth Century. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a264 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Smith, Nigel.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation presents a new interpretation of imaginative literature’s role in the political and religious controversies that precipitated the institutional embrace of toleration, including in the political philosophy of John Locke, toward the end of the seventeenth century. Within that larger story, it traces an evolution in the conception of religious difference in early modern English culture through its ongoing controversies concerning the status of the liturgical and ceremonial aspects of Protestantism that were designated as “indifferent.” It argues that the interpretive practices at stake in the controversies, which rendered material aspects of religious practice complexly figural and discursive, were shaped by the application and testing of those practices in literary texts. By bringing the period’s religious poetry into conversation with its ecclesiological and political discourses, it shows how authors experimented with the different senses in which things and practices were considered indifferent with respect to salvation, and therefore tolerable. In that way, the argument contributes to the intellectual and cultural histories of religious toleration.At the center of the project is the important but understudied theological concept of adiaphora. In the political-theological imagination of the period, this term was used to address questions of protestant material culture and ritual practice by distinguishing between religion’s circumstantial, negotiable, and “indifferent” practices (adiaphora) and its essential doctrines (fundamenta). The dissertation reads the figurative language of the period where it interacts with this concept. It situates the early modern discourse of adiaphora within recent historical and theoretical scholarship on religious toleration, drawing on methodologies from literary studies, the history of ideas, and the historiography of the English Church to challenge the prevailing notion that the English Church’s policy of “indifference to matters of indifference” was among the preconditions for toleration’s emergence as the central value of Anglophone liberalism. Through readings of works by John Donne, George Herbert, John Milton, and Aphra Behn, it demonstrates the significance of the concept of things indifferent” for the period's cultural representations of religious diversity within the parameters suggested by a national Church committed to religious uniformity. In doing so, finally, the project establishes the basis for a new genealogy of the cultural and political categories through which liberal polities today grapple with differences of religion, race, and gender.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aBritish & Irish literature. 4aReligious history. 4aEuropean history.  aAdiaphora  aDonne  aHerbert  aLocke  aMilton  aToleration  a17th century  a0593  a0335  a032020aPrinceton University.bEnglish.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854271202252nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002100131245005500152260005800207300001100265500007800276500003800354502004800392506005900440520091500499590002301414650001301437650001301450650001401463653002301477653001801500653002001518690000901538690000901547690000901556710003601565773005101601790000901652791001001661792000901671793001201680856015001692AAI2854272620220920004310.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106826  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28542726  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aPhan, Trung Van.10aSwarm Intelligence in Natural and Synthetic Lives. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a176 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Austin, Robert Hamilton.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aReal world phenomena are inherently nonlinear and complex in a way that usually cannot be understood from the first principle. Yet intelligence behaviors appear in biological systems, which are shaped by billions of years of evolution, to solve natural challenges. Here, we show a form of collective intelligence at microbial level, emerged in a swarm of strongly interacting single-cell organisms as they navigate through complicated topologies and avoid dangers in dynamical environments. We then develop a robotic system in which autonomous robots with bio-inspired functions move over a programmable adaptive landscape. The robot swarm can self-organized to optimize resource consumption and survive stressful conditions by emulating organic biology, exhibiting what we call robobiology. We conclude by sketching out future research directions with scientific questions that our robotic system can address.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPhysics. 4aBiology. 4aRobotics.  aSwarm intelligence  aNatural lives  aSynthetic lives  a0605  a0306  a077120aPrinceton University.bPhysics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854272603952nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001800131245005900149260005800208300001100266500007800277500005500355502004800410506005900458520251800517590002303035650002603058650002103084650002703105653003303132653002503165653002003190690000903210690000903219690000903228710006403237773005103301790000903352791001003361792000903371793001203380856015003392AAI2854358520220920004310.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486021  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28543585  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aJiang, Yundi.10aData-Driven Multiscale Modeling of Gas-Particle Flows. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a127 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Sundaresan, Sankaran;Kevrekidis, Ioannis.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aFluidized beds have a wide application in the industry. The gas-particle flows in fluidized beds are inherently unstable with multiscale structures. Insights gained from computational simulations can effectively accelerate the process and technology development of such complex flow systems. For industrial-scale devices, tracking and resolving the vast number of particles is impractical due to computational cost. Therefore the Two-Fluid Model (TFM), which solves continuum equations of motion for both fluid and particle phases, is introduced. High-resolution TFM simulations can resolve various fine structures when the mesh size is small, but it becomes prohibitively expensive for large-scale systems, leading to the development of filtered Two-Fluid Model (fTFM). fTFM requires an accurate filtered drag model to account for the significant sub-grid contribution arising from the inhomogeneities within the filtering volume. This thesis develops a neural-network-based filtered drag model from a dataset constructed by filtering simulation results of a dense fluidized bed. Compared to previous filtered drag models, the new model includes an additional marker, gas-phase pressure gradient, which is identified through theoretical derivation and budget analysis. Validation tests through a priori analysis show high prediction accuracy, and a posteriori analysis with coarse grid simulations show good agreement between fine- and coarse-grid simulations. After the filtered drag model development, we continue to tackle two essential challenges. The first challenge concerns the filter size. Industrial devices require large filter sizes. Computationally developed coarse models are commonly based on rather small fine-grid simulations, and extrapolation is carried out for large-scale simulations. Verification on the accuracy of these extrapolations is generally lacking. We approach this problem through systematic verification tests using a cascading framework. We demonstrate that the extrapolation of the neural-network-based model to large grid sizes works satisfactorily. The second question is related to the gas-particle systems to which the filtered drag model can be applied. We analyze and assemble a dataset from different combinations of gas and particle properties, and identify Reynolds number as a suitable additional marker to combine the results from all different cases. The resulting general model for drag correction is applicable to a wide range of gas and particle characteristics.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aChemical engineering. 4aFluid mechanics. 4aComputational physics.  aComputational fluid dynamics  aData-driven modeling  aMultiphase flow  a0542  a0204  a021620aPrinceton University.bChemical and Biological Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854358503904nam a2200457   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001900131245007300150260005800223300001100281500007800292500003400370502004800404506006900452506005900521520238300580590002302963650002802986650002203014650001903036653001103055653001403066653001103080653001103091653001003102653001703112690000903129690000903138690000903147710004903156773005103205790000903256791001003265792000903275793001203284856015003296AAI2854373020220920004310.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486175  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28543730  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aDargin, Cevat.10aState-Making in Dersim across Empire and Nation-State (1878–1938). 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a417 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Reynolds, Micheal A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aWhen the Young Turks and Kemalists declared new regimes in 1908 and in 1923 respectively, they put forth grand narratives of radical change. This dissertation, by contrast, highlights the continuity across the Hamidian (1876–1908), Young Turks (1908–1923), and Early Republican (1923–1938) eras in state making by examining the history of Dersim, a Kizilbash/Alevi Kurdish–majority region in Eastern Anatolia. Due to its unusual geographic and demographic profile, Dersim toward the end of the nineteenth century became a domain where the Kurdish, Armenian, and Kizilbash/Alevi questions intersected and clashed with the project of Ottoman and Turkish state building. These interwoven questions placed foundational limits to the late imperial and early republican state in the realms of ethnicity, religion, and geography and turned Dersim into a battlefield for Turkish state making.Dersim remained largely outside the reach of the state until the Turkish state rendered Dersim accessible by building railways, roads, bridges, and military outposts inside Dersim and then utilizing novel technologies of war such as aerial bombardment and poison gas to subdue the region. Efforts to subjugate Dersimis began as part of early nineteenth century reforms and intensified when defeat in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 raised alarm among Ottoman authorities about their state’s future prospects of in Eastern Anatolia, among other places. After taming Dersim’s geography, which until then had served as a refuge for people evading state control, government forces killed a substantial number of its inhabitants, humans and livestock alike, in 1937–38; dissolved the local Kizilbash/Alevi socioreligious belief system embedded in Dersim’s natural environment; and imposed strict coercive measures over the remaining population to assimilate them into Sunni Turks.This study explores the myriad ways in which Turkish, Kurdish, Armenian, and Kizilbash/Alevi histories overlap and diverge. It examines conflict and cooperation between Dersim Kurds and Armenians and qualifies the metanarratives of collective communal violence that treat ethnic and religious communities as monolithic entities. The dissertation also serves as an introduction to an environmental history of the region by highlighting the role of geography in the histories of Dersim’s inhabitants.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMiddle Eastern studies. 4aEuropean history. 4aAsian history.  aAlevis  aArmenians  aDersim  aEmpire  aKurds  aNation-state  a0555  a0335  a033220aPrinceton University.bNear Eastern Studies.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854373003382nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001800131245006600149260005800215300001100273500007800284500002900362502004800391506005900439520197400498590002302472650002302495650002902518650002702547653002302574653003902597653002902636690000902665690000902674690000902683710003902692773005102731790000902782791001002791792000902801793001202810856015002822AAI2854378120220920004310.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106499  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28543781  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aZhao, Zidong.10aEmotion Prediction Across Naturalistic Relationship Contexts. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a189 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Tamir, Diana I.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aEmotions change over time, and the temporal dynamics of emotions vary considerably from individual to individual and from group to group. Successful social interactions require people to track this moving target in order to anticipate the thoughts, feelings, and actions of others. In this dissertation, I combine behavioral studies and computational modeling to study how people make emotion predictions that are both accurate and specific to individual partners across three naturalistic relationship contexts. In Chapter 1, I establish that people can indeed make accurate, emotion predictions at a partner-specific level. They do so by relying on specialized knowledge about their partner to account for individual-level emotional idiosyncrasies. Furthermore, I show that how well people make partner-specific emotion predictions is associated with their social success. In Chapter 2, I explore the inferential strategies that support emotion prediction when people encounter new social partners. I show that people can use self-knowledge to effectively approximate other's emotion dynamics. I also show that people are attuned to the utility of their self-knowledge, such that those who are more typical relied on their self-knowledge to a greater extent. In Chapter 3, I investigate how partner-specific emotion prediction can rapidly emerge as new social partners start accumulating specialized knowledge about each other. I demonstrate that people understand the latent structure of how emotion dynamics might vary across individuals in the population. They exploit this structure, and use induction-like mechanisms to quickly individuate their emotion predictions, after learning only a small amount of information about a novel social partner. This work highlights that in order to gain a fuller understanding of the mechanisms underlying predictive social cognition, it is imperative to study it in conjunction with its naturalistic contexts and constraints.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aSocial psychology. 4aQuantitative psychology. 4aBehavioral psychology.  aEmotion prediction  aNaturalistic relationship contexts  aSuccessful interactions   a0451  a0632  a038420aPrinceton University.bPsychology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854378103953nam a2200481   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002400131245006200155260005800217300001100275500007800286500003000364502004800394506005900442520242000501590002302921650001302944650001602957650001302973650001802986650002303004653002803027653001903055653002903074653002103103653002503124690000903149690000903158690000903167690000903176690000903185710003603194773005103230790000903281791001003290792000903300793001203309856015003321AAI2854416220220920004311.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106604  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28544162  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aWeiner, Benjamin G.14aThe Physics of Spatial Differentiation in Living Systems. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a108 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Wingreen, Ned S.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aLiving systems exhibit spatial differentiation at every scale, from the functional compartments within cells to the biogeography of multi-species communities. In this dissertation, we investigate the emergence and consequences of spatial differentiation in two contexts: biomolecular condensates in eukaryotic cells (Chapter 1) and resource competition between territorial communities (Chapter 2). We begin at the intracellular level, where eukaryotes are able to organize important biomolecules and tasks into condensates which lack a membrane. Many such condensates are liquid droplets which phase separate due to interactions between their component molecules, but it remains difficult to bridge spatial scales and determine how molecular properties shape condensate properties. In Chapter 1, we study two important aspects of condensates' molecular architecture: 1) the role of specific interactions which are one-to-one and saturating, and 2) the sequence of interaction motifs, which is under the control of evolution and regulation. Using Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field theory, we show that the motif sequence has a dramatic effect on the thermodynamic and material properties of biomolecular condensates. Sequences with larger domains of repeated motifs phase separate under a much wider range of conditions, and the resulting condensates are much more viscous and solid-like. We find that the sequence primarily acts through the entropy of intramolecular interactions, a new mechanism for the biological control of phase separation. Having shown how spatial differentiation emerges at the intracellular level, we zoom out to the ecological level to understand how spatial structure shapes biodiversity and population dynamics. Many important ecosystems are comprised of populations which compete for both territory and diffusing resources (e.g. bacterial biofilms, terrestrial plants, coral and mussels). How diverse will such an ecosystem be, compared to a well-mixed system with the same competitors but no spatial organization? Using a model that couples mechanistic interactions to biophysical constraints, we unexpectedly find that space reduces biodiversity but renders it more robust to differences in intrinsic metabolic capacity. Finally, we conclude by asking whether these two disparate case studies offer any general lessons for theorists grappling with space and difference in biology.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPhysics. 4aBiophysics. 4aEcology. 4aMicrobiology. 4aMolecular biology.  aSpatial differentiation  aLiving systems  aBiomolecular condensates  aEukaryotic cells  aResource competition  a0605  a0786  a0329  a0410  a030720aPrinceton University.bPhysics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854416203415nam a2200385   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002600131245005300157260005800210300001100268500007800279500003400357502004800391506005900439520205600498590002302554650002902577653002302606653002602629653002302655653002902678653002702707690000902734710004502743773005102788790000902839791001002848792000902858793001202867856015002879AAI2854428320220920004311.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106956  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28544283  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aGundersen, Gregory W.10aPractical Algorithms for Latent Variable Models. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a239 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Engelhardt, Barbara.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aLatent variables allow researchers and engineers to encode assumptions into their statistical models. A latent variable might, for example, represent an unobserved covariate, measurement error, or a missing class label. Inference is challenging because one must account for the conditional dependence structure induced by these variables, and marginalization is often intractable. In this thesis, I present several practical algorithms for inferring latent structure in probabilistic models used in computational biology, neuroscience, and time-series analysis.First, I present a multi-view framework that combines neural networks and probabilistic canonical correlation analysis to estimate shared and view-specific latent structure of paired samples of histological images and gene expression levels. The model is trained end-to-end to estimate all parameters simultaneously, and we show that the latent variables capture interpretable structure, such as tissue-specific and morphological variation. Next, I present a family of nonlinear dimension-reduction models that use random features to support non-Gaussian data likelihoods. By approximating a nonlinear relationship between the latent variables and observations with a function that is linear with respect to random features, we induce closed-form gradients of the posterior distribution with respect to the latent variables. This allows for gradient-based nonlinear dimension-reduction models for a variety of data likelihoods. Finally, I discuss lowering the computational cost of online Bayesian filtering of time series with abrupt changes in structure, called changepoints. We consider settings in which a time series has multiple data sources, each with an associated cost. We trade the cost of a data source against the quality or fidelity of that source and how its fidelity affects the estimation of changepoints. Our framework makes cost-sensitive decisions about which data source to use based on minimizing the information entropy of the posterior distribution over changepoints.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aArtificial intelligence.  aBayesian inference  aChangepoint detection  aGaussian processes  aLatent variable modeling  aProbabilistic modeling  a080020aPrinceton University.bComputer Science.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854428302638nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002500131245004800156260005800204300001100262500007800273500003700351502004800388506005900436520124700495590002301742650002601765650002301791653001401814653001401828653001801842653001801860653002101878653001901899690000901918690000901927710003901936773005101975790000902026791001002035792000902045793001202054856015002066AAI2854442720220920004311.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486120  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28544427  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aBio, Branden Joseph.10aModeling Awareness for the Self and Others. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a142 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Graziano, Michael S.

However, one fundamentalaspect of this, how the awareness of others is modeled and where this ability is rooted in thebrain, is still not well understood. The experiments described in this dissertation investigate howindividuals understand and reconstruct the awareness and attention of others and the ways theseprocesses relate to the construction of their own awareness. The study presented in chapter 2offers evidence that the ways in which individuals use and combine information to assess others’awareness is closely tied to their social cognitive ability. Chapters 3 and 4 provide evidence thatan individual's attentional biases seem to transfer when modeling the attention of others,demonstrating a tight relationship between understanding others’ attention and one’s own.Finally, the studies presented in chapters 5 and 6 suggest that areas of the brain responsible forcognition about others represent rich content of another agent's awareness as well as detailsabout the agent's attention. These studies provide support for the concept that models of the selfand models of others have shared mechanisms that may rely on the same underlying neuralsubstrates.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aCognitive psychology. 4aSocial psychology.  aAttention  aAwareness  aConsciousness  aMental models  aSocial cognition  aTheory of mind  a0633  a045120aPrinceton University.bPsychology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854442703953nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002600131245006300157260005800220300001100278500007800289500003500367502004800402506005900450520247600509590002302985650001903008650002603027650002903053653001903082653001803101653002903119653001503148653002203163653001303185690000903198690000903207690000903216710004103225773005103266790000903317791001003326792000903336793001203345856015003357AAI2854447020220920004311.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486274  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28544470  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aPiloto, Luis Rolando.10aLearning Intuitive Physics: A Computational Investigation. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a152 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Botvinick, Matthew M.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aIntuitive physics is the ability to reason about three-dimensional objects, their dynamic interactions, and responses to forces. The development of intuitive physical knowledge in humans has been extensively catalogued by developmental psychologists in order to study the "origins of knowledge." It is at the center of a debate, parallel to that of language, between nativists and empiricists. Nativists have demonstrated evidence of physical intuition as early as 2.5 months of age (by some accounts even younger) suggesting domain-specific constraints on learning. Empiricists have shown (for some domains) that general-purpose learning principles, instantiated via artificial neural networks, are capable of producing the stage-like progression of rule-like behavior seen in infants. However, methodological limitations abound on both sides, impeding progress on this dialog. Nativists have experimental limits on probing newborns and young infants due to perceptual and attentional constraints. Empiricists have only been able to build learning systems for gross simplifications of the physical world, abstracting sensory information to physical quantities and learning based on that.The main contribution of this thesis is to capitalize on advances in deep learning to build models that can actually learn intuitive physics from visual data. In doing so, this work unlocks a necessary component for mapping the mechanisms of intuitive physical knowledge: any model that seeks to provide a mechanistic account of learning phenomenon must first be able to learn that phenomenon. We adopt the Violation-of-Expectation paradigm used in developmental psychology to probe infant physical intuition and build a synthetic dataset to probe physical knowledge in deep neural networks. In Chapter 2, we build a model with a domain-general architecture and find it only capable of narrow generalization of intuitive physics knowledge. In Chapter 3, we build a model with an object-centric inductive bias (reflecting hypothesized domain-specific constraints) and find it is capable of learning generalized physical concepts with as little as 28 hours of visual experience in our synthetic 3D environment. Furthermore, we ablate the architecture and find the object-centric components are necessary for the rich generalization. Finally, Chapter 4 briefly elaborates potential mechanisms for learning necessary components of the object-centric model: object discovery and tracking.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aNeurosciences. 4aCognitive psychology. 4aArtificial intelligence.  aCore knowledge  aDeep learning  aDevelopmental psychology  aEmpiricism  aIntuitive physics  aNativism  a0317  a0633  a080020aPrinceton University.bNeuroscience.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854447003672nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002400131245009600155260005800251300001100309500007800320500004600398500002600444502004800470506005900518520223100577590002302808650001502831653002102846653002202867653001202889653002202901653002402923653002702947690000902974710003802983773005103021790000903072791001003081792000903091793001203100856015003112AAI2854454820220920004312.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486106  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28544548  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aHaugbro, Michael R.10aDevelopment of in-situ Protein Engineering Technologies for the Study of Modified Proteins. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a271 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aIncludes supplementary digital materials.  aAdvisor: Muir, Tom W.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aDeciphering the roles that protein post-translational modifications, protein-protein interactions, and protein dynamics play in modulating protein structure and function requires the ability to introduce amino acid modifications, cross-linking moieties, biophysical probes, and other synthetic chemical species into proteins. Current technologies for the semi-synthesis of modified proteins are optimized for in vitro reactions and are not easily transferable to more biologically relevant systems such as live cell culture. Analogous methodologies that work in situ rely on genetic manipulations that often result in low resolution data and a high level of off-target effects. Early attempts to address this disconnect have employed protein ligase systems such as Sortase and split inteins, but as of yet have not become robust enough for wide-spread use. In this thesis we expand upon the existing technologies and introduce new methods for the precise chemical manipulation of proteins in cell culture using split inteins. We applied in-nucleo protein trans-splicing to determine the in situ interactome of histone PTMs, combining chemical precision and native protein environment in an unprecedented manner unattainable by any other approach. The full results of the proteomics experiments enabled by this technique can be found in Appendix 2, available with the digital version of this thesis. We also expanded the in situ PTS toolbox by developing a multiplexed method for histone labeling in nuclei and in live cells. We demonstrated this capability by labeling two histones with different color fluorophores in a completely orthogonal manner. Finally, we utilized an atypical split intein known as VidaL to achieve the first semi-synthesis of a modified protein in cells, generating histones bearing multiple PTMs and an affinity handle in the chromatin of live cells. We added to this platform by combining our semi-synthesis capabilities with control of the subcellular localization of our target protein, in a single reaction. We envision that these new methods described in this thesis will equip protein chemists and cellular biologists alike with new capabilities for the study of protein structure and function.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aChemistry.  aChemical biology  aChromatin biology  aInteins  aProtein chemistry  aProtein engineering  aProtein semi-synthesis  a048520aPrinceton University.bChemistry.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854454804071nam a2200433   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002500131245011400156260005800270300001100328500007800339500002800417502004800445506005900493520260800552590002303160650002603183650001203209650001503221653001103236653001003247653001503257653001003272653002303282690000903305690000903314690000903323710006403332773005103396790000903447791001003456792000903466793001203475856015003487AAI2854460320220920004312.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106468  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28544603  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aHamill, Joseph Clay.10aSolution Chemistry Affects Processing and Properties of Perovskite Active Layers for Solar Energy Conversion. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a221 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Loo, Yueh-Lin.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aHybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have recently emerged as a promising class of photoactive materials for use as active layers in efficacious photovoltaic (PV) devices. Yet, numerous obstacles must be overcome before PV devices comprising HOIP active layers are ready to be integrated into the renewable energy market. In this thesis, we systematically studied interactions and reactions between HOIP precursors and processing solvents/additives to elucidate how structuring in solution affects crystallization kinetics, morphology, composition, structure, and optoelectronic properties of the solid-state HOIP active layer.We demonstrate that the strength of interactions between processing solvent and the lead halide HOIP precursor impacts coordination in solution and the crystallization kinetics of HOIP materials. We identified a correlation between the Lewis basicity of the processing solvent, quantified by Gutmann’s donor number (DN), and the strength of interactions between common oxygen-donor solvents and lead halide precursor. Subsequently, we extended this analysis to include sulfur-donor solvents, demonstrating that hard and soft acid base theory is a reliable predictor of coordination strength between Pb2+ and solvents and/or additives in HOIP precursor solutions. Our studies provide a comprehensive design rule for solvent selection for HOIP processing and identifies acid-base interactions as a primary driver of structuring in the precursor solution.Separately, we demonstrated that reactions between processing solvents/additives and organoammonium halide precursors results in the formation of organic products, which when incorporated in the solid state, act as substitutional defects in HOIP thin films. The incorporation of these products in HOIP films directly influences the composition and crystal structure of the films and alters the optoelectronic properties of HOIP active layers for device applications. This study represents a vital first step in understanding the origins of compositional drifts, structural heterogeneity, and electronic defects in HOIP active layers, and will guide future work to identify precursor formulations that eliminate such deleterious reactions. Collectively, this thesis underscores the importance of considering the interactions and reactions between perovskite precursors in solution and their effects on solid-state structure and properties and serves as a fundamental undergirding for improved understanding of processing-structure-function relationships of HOIP active layers for optoelectronic and PV applications.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aChemical engineering. 4aEnergy. 4aChemistry.  aEnergy  aEXAFS  aPerovskite  aSolar  aSolution chemistry  a0542  a0791  a048520aPrinceton University.bChemical and Biological Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854460303801nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002600131245008000157260005800237300001100295500007800306500003200384502004800416506005900464520231700523590002302840650002002863650002002883653001802903653003102921653002702952653002102979653002103000653002303021690000903044690000903053710007603062773005103138790000903189791001003198792000903208793001203217856015003229AAI2854476520220920004312.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486243  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28544765  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aKraus, Brian Francis.10aShort-Pulse-Heated Plasma Dynamics near Solid Density via X-Ray Lineshapes. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a229 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Efthimion, Philip.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aIntense, short-pulse lasers interacting with solid materials tend to produce particles in two regimes: relativistic particles, which quickly exit the interaction region and are well-studied, and bulk, thermal particles, which are highly collisional, near solid density, and have been difficult to diagnose. The bulk population is nonetheless important as an X-ray source for radiography and as a highly collisional platform for fusion and electron equilibration studies. The work presented here sheds light on this challenging regime via X-ray spectroscopy, measuring thermal line emission from highly charged ions near the laser focus with high-resolution Bragg crystal spectrometers.Three central advances have made these studies possible: (1) ultrahigh-contrast laser technology that heats solid-density material to high temperatures; (2) laser targets with thin Ti tracer layers embedded in Al foils, used to distinguish emission from a fine-grained series of depths relative to the laser-facing surface; and (3) high-resolution, spherically bent Bragg crystal X-ray spectrometers, developed for magnetically confined plasmas and here applied to plasmas heated by short-pulse lasers. This thesis relies on laser technology developed externally to generate novel data with newly applied targets and spectrometers. These experiments capture well-resolved fine-structure line emission from solid-density plasmas with reduced spatial gradients, mapping their spectral characteristics in space.Analysis of the observed X-ray lineshapes yields two contributions that enhance our understanding of short-pulse-heated plasmas. Firstly, Doppler-shifted lineshapes imply the velocity distributions of solid-density ions, a new measurement that reveals heretofore unobserved rapid acceleration of bulk ions. Secondly, Stark-broadened lineshapes show both double-peaked structure and quantifiable redshifts; both are hallmarks of emission from high-density plasmas which jointly constrain both electron density and ion temperature. These developments showcase the usefulness of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy for observation of dense plasmas, here put in service of identifying new physics phenomena in laser-heated solids. These techniques are potentially applicable to a wide variety of high-energy-density systems.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPlasma physics. 4aAtomic physics.  aDoppler shift  aHigh-energy-density plasma  aLaser-produced plasmas  aStark broadening  aX-ray lineshapes  aX-ray spectroscopy  a0759  a074820aPrinceton University.bAstrophysical Sciences—Plasma Physics Program.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854476503644nam a2200433   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001500131245006400146260005800210300001100268500007800279500003600357502004800393506005900441520217600500590002302676650002602699650002702725650002002752653002502772653002602797653001602823653001802839653002402857690000902881690000902890690000902899710006102908773005102969790000903020791001003029792000903039793001203048856015003060AAI2854505020220920004313.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106857  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28545050  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aZhang, Yi.10aSome Theoretical Thinking on the Changing Tropical Climate. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a100 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Fueglistaler, Stephan.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation synthesizes long-standing theoretical ideas to develop quantitative constraints on several aspects of tropical climate, namely convection, heat stress, precipitation, and outgoing longwave radiation. A zeroth-order picture of the tropical troposphere is that deep convection maintains a moist adiabatic temperature profile in the vertical and gravity waves quickly smooth any temperature gradients in the horizontal, which is formally known as convective quasi-equilibrium (QE) and the weak-temperature-gradient (WTG) assumption. We expect that strict QE-WTG should yield a uniform moist static energy (MSE) threshold for deep convection. Consistent with the theoretical expectation, we find that deep convection only occurs over the highest subcloud MSEs and that the convective subcloud MSE (daily-mean subcloud MSE weighted by precipitation) is roughly uniform between 20°S and 20°N. QE-WTG forces the highest subcloud MSEs to be equal over land and ocean, not only in the present climate but also in much colder and warmer climates.The annual-maximum wet-bulb temperature, a metric for extreme heat stress, is also controlled by the QE-WTG dynamics due to the functional relationship of wet-bulb temperature with MSE. We provide a theoretical projection that the annual-maximum wet-bulb temperature will increase roughly uniformly by about 1°C for each 1°C of tropical mean warming. This result suggests that limiting the mean surface warming also limits heat stress extremes in the tropics.QE-WTG controls the occurrence of deep convection and thus precipitation. Global climate models consistently predict that tropical precipitation will be distributed more unevenly in space with global warming. We show that the unevenness of precipitation can be traced back to the unevenness of subcloud MSE distribution. We then explain the change in sublcoud MSE distribution with a simple scaling accounting for the Clausius-Clapeyron increases of boundary-layer specific humidity under invariant relative humidities. The invariance of relative humidities also has implications for the linearity of outgoing longwave radiation with surface temperature.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aAtmospheric sciences. 4aAtmospheric chemistry. 4aClimate change.  aAtmospheric dynamics  aAtmospheric radiation  aHeat stress  aPrecipitation  aTropical convection  a0725  a0404  a037120aPrinceton University.bAtmospheric and Oceanic Sciences.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854505005532nam a2200433   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001900131245012600150260005800276300001100334500007800345500003200423502004800455506005900503520406000562590002304622650002304645650002204668650001404690653001604704653001704720653001504737653001204752653002004764690000904784690000904793690000904802710004604811773005104857790000904908791001004917792000904927793001204936856015004948AAI2854523120220920004313.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106888  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28545231  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aSheng, Xinlei.10aInvestigating the Function of Human Sirtuin 3 in Regulating Mitochondrial Morphology and Function During Viral Infection. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a253 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Cristea, Ileana M.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe regulation of mitochondrial structure and function in mammalian cells is central to many distinct viral infections as means to modulate cellular metabolism and immune responses. Indeed, alterations in mitochondria morphology and functions can be observed across evolutionarily distinct viral infections. Among these viruses is the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a ubiquitous β-herpesvirus that has an ancient history of co-evolution with its host. Current perspectives of HCMV host-pathogen interactions point towards a role for protein acetylation within the mitochondria as a toggle between pro- and anti-virus host responses, with the mitochondrial deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) being found to antagonize HCMV.In my thesis work, I investigated the antiviral functions of SIRT3 and, more broadly, the temporal regulation and functions of protein acetylation events during HCMV infection. By integrating proteomics, virology, bioinformatics, and microscopy, I defined the temporal landscape of protein acetylation during the course of HCMV infection in human fibroblasts. This study revealed acetylation occurring on both viral and host proteins that highlighted pro- and anti-viral functions of this modification. Although alterations in protein acetylation were found in many subcellular organelles, the most striking change that I uncovered was a global upregulation of hundreds of acetylation sites on mitochondrial proteins. Moreover, numerous known or predicted SIRT3 substrates displayed dynamic acetylations during infection. Indeed, I demonstrate that the deacetylase activity of SIRT3 is necessary for its ability to suppress virus production. To understand the mechanisms underlying SIRT3 antiviral function, I defined the temporality of SIRT3-substrate interactions during infection. Concomitant with changes in acetylation levels, SIRT3 dynamically associated with the mitochondrial fusion factor Optic Atrophy (OPA1). By employing microscopy and virology assays, I demonstrate that the acetylation state of OPA1 modulates mitochondrial morphology of infected cells and inhibits HCMV production. In addition to the known K834 site on OPA1, I discover another acetylation site, K931, is targeted by the SIRT3 deacetylase. Indeed, I show that OPA1 K931 acetylation restricts HCMV infection. Together with the finding that SIRT3 is critical for regulating mitochondrial pH, membrane potential, and structure along with a comprehensive annotation of SIRT3-substrate interactions during infection these data indicate a role for SIRT3 in the regulation of cellular metabolism. For example, I demonstrate that SIRT3 loses its association with the acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 2 (ACAA2), a protein functioning in fatty acid beta-oxidation, concomitant with increased ACAA2 acetylation that also impacts HCMV infection.Finally, to gain a broader view of the impact of HCMV infection of the regulation of proteins and their interactions, we employed thermal proximity coaggregation (TPCA) mass spectrometry. This approach allowed us to monitor at a system level the maintenance, dissociation and association of functional protein complexes during the HCMV replication cycle. These dynamic interactions reflected organelle remodeling events, as well as functional movements of proteins. For example, by examining our interaction dataset and performing functional follow-up assays, we discovered that the HCMV co-receptor integrin beta 1 (ITGB1) dissociates from extracellular matrix proteins, becoming internalized with the tetraspanin CD63, which is necessary for virus production.In conclusion, my thesis study has characterized the temporal and spatial regulation of protein acetylation on both host and viral proteins. By integrating multiple datasets and functional assays, I uncovered two of the SIRT3 substrates that mediate the antiviral function of SIRT3. This work provides insight into the regulation of protein acetylation and protein-protein interactions during viral infection, and may facilitate the development of antiviral treatment.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMolecular biology. 4aCellular biology. 4aVirology.  aAcetylation  aMitochondria  aProteomics  aSirtuin  aVirus infection  a0307  a0379  a072020aPrinceton University.bMolecular Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854523105971nam a2200505   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002200131245008800153260005800241300001100299500007800310500003500388502004800423506005900471520430900530590002304839650001604862650002904878650002604907650002804933650002004961650002304981653002105004653001405025653002305039653002405062653002005086690000905106690000905115690000905124690000905133690000905142690000905151710006405160773005105224790000905275791001005284792000905294793001205303856015005315AAI2854534420220920004313.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106536  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28545344  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aKozuch, Daniel J.10aInvestigation of Biological Systems at Low Temperatures Using Molecular Simulation. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a200 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Debenedetti, Pablo G.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aA major outstanding problem in the field of biological physics is to properly understand the behavior of biological systems outside physiological conditions, especially at the molecular level. In this thesis, we focus mainly on the behavior of biological systems at low temperatures. These conditions are fundamentally interesting from a theoretical perspective, but they are also particularly relevant for engineering applications, such as anti-icing, crop hardiness, cryogenic electron microscopy, and cryopreservation. To probe the behavior of these systems at the molecular level, we ran advanced molecular dynamics simulations which were processed with a variety of computational and machine learning techniques.In the second chapter of this thesis, we investigated the metastable folding behavior of a model peptide, Trp-cage, at deeply supercooled temperatures using a combination of parallel tempering and metadynamics. From these simulations, we observed novel re-folding of the peptide at temperatures more than 50 K below the freezing point of the system. This re-folding was found to correlate with the continuous transition of the water from a high density liquid state to a lower density liquid state. Protein-water hydrogen bonds were found to be less favorable in the low density water, suggesting that this cold re-folding is driven by the expulsion of water bound to the protein core, which allows the protein to re-fold into the same structure observed at ambient temperatures.In the third chapter, we used standard molecular dynamics simulations to study the dynamic properties of antifreeze proteins (AFPs), which are a diverse class of proteins that non-colligatively depress the freezing point of water by binding to nascent ice crystals. From these simulations, we developed a neural network model that could predict the experimentally observed antifreeze activity of the AFPs from the structure of the AFPs and the dynamics of hydrogen bonding measured near the surface of the AFPs. Then, in the fourth chapter, we implemented this neural network model as a fitness function in a genetic algorithm. This algorithm was applied to three naturally occurring AFPs, and we found that for two of the three AFPs, the algorithm produced mutants that have predicted activities that are significantly higher than the wild type.In the fifth chapter, we considered how the cryopreservative trehalose impacts the behavior of a model membrane composed of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) lipids under rapid cooling. To do this, we ran molecular dynamics simulations in which the temperature of the system was progressively dropped in a step-wise manner from 350 K to 250 K using both all-atom (AA) and coarse-grained (CG) resolution. Analysis of the AA simulations showed that at sufficiently high concentrations, trehalose inhibits the formation of the major domain of the ripple phase at low temperatures, favoring the formation of the thinner, interdigitated minor domain. In the CG simulations, the ripple phase does not form at low temperatures; instead, the system transitions directly from the liquid crystalline phase to the gel phase. Even so, we observed that increasing the concentration of trehalose in the CG system inhibits the formation of the gel phase at low temperatures, leading to a thinner membrane as was observed with the AA system. Finally, in the sixth chapter, we departed from our focus on low temperature systems. In collaboration with an experimental group, we studied the molecular level details of hydrophobic ion pairing (HIP) in which the hydrophobicity of a target drug, polymyxin B (PB), was effectively increased by electrostatically pairing it with an ionic surfactant, oleic acid (OA). Using molecular dynamics, we measured how variables such as solvent composition, OA:PB ratio, and system size affected the hydrophobicity of the resulting complex. From these simulations, we also monitored the kinetics of complexation, allowing us to extrapolate the expected time scales for particle assembly on experimentally observed length scales. Lastly, we probed the morphology of the resulting complexes, but calculation of charge distributions within the complex were unable to explain the surface charge stabilization observed in experiment.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aBiophysics. 4aComputational chemistry. 4aChemical engineering. 4aBiomedical engineering. 4aBioinformatics. 4aMolecular biology.  aMachine Learning  aMembranes  aMolecular dynamics  aProtein engineering  aProtein folding  a0786  a0219  a0542  a0541  a0307  a071520aPrinceton University.bChemical and Biological Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854534403778nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100003000131245011300161260005800274300001100332500007800343500002900421502004800450506005900498520229900557590002302856650002302879650001802902650002302920653002902943653002602972653003002998653002203028690000903050690000903059690000903068710003803077773005103115790000903166791001003175792000903185793001203194856015003206AAI2854570920220920004313.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106772  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28545709  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aClayman, Phillip Douglas.10aPhotoenzymatic Reductions: Catalytic Promiscuity Enabled by Charge Transfer Complexes and Direct Excitation. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a267 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Hyster, Todd K.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aEnzymes, nature’s catalysts, are capable of incredible rate accelerations and unparalleled selectivities. Due to the biological importance of chiral compounds, methods for selectively synthesizing one enantiomer of a compound over the other are particularly relevant, and enzymes are ideally suited to this task. Moreover, enzymes offer several advantages over other modes of catalysis, particularly with regards to sustainability, and they can be optimized as catalysts by the Nobel Prize winning technique of directed evolution. These factors have led to the adoption of certain biocatalytic enzymes for the production of pharmaceutically relevant compounds on an industrial scale. However, despite these advances, the number of types of reactions catalyzed by enzymes is dwarfed by the diversity of transformations used in the rest of organic synthesis. The research described here focuses on the development of new reactivity in existing biocatalytic enzymes, such that known benefits of these enzymes can be applied towards new transformations. Of particular interest are new asymmetric radical transformations, as radicals have proved to be powerful intermediates in organic synthesis, but methods for controlling the stereoselectivity of radical reactions remain underdeveloped. By utilizing the latent photochemical activity of enzymatic cofactors, we enable access to new radical intermediates within enzyme active sites. Moreover, we can utilize these radicals to form carbon-carbon bonds and control the stereoselectivity of an important radical terminating step, hydrogen atom transfer. In the first project discussed, new photoenzymatic reactivity is enabled by the formation of a charge transfer complex between substrate and flavin cofactor within the active site of flavin-dependent ‘ene’-reductases. Irradiation of this complex allows for the generation of unstabilized alkyl radicals. In the second project discussed, new reactivity is the result of high reducing potentials obtained by directly exciting flavin. This enables the reduction of acrylamides via a novel single electron transfer mechanism. Finally, an initially promising but ultimately unsuccessful dual catalytic system is described, along with ongoing efforts towards a biocatalytic Reformatsky reaction.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aOrganic chemistry. 4aBiochemistry. 4aMolecular biology.  aPhotoenzymatic reduction  aCatalytic promiscuity  aChange transfer complexes  aDirect excitation  a0490  a0487  a030720aPrinceton University.bChemistry.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854570903603nam a2200433   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002400131245008700155260005800242300001100300500007800311500002900389502004800418506006900466506005900535520210600594590002302700650001502723650002302738653001702761653001702778653001902795653001902814653001502833653002402848690000902872690000902881710003802890773005102928790000902979791001002988792000902998793001203007856015003019AAI2854575620220920004314.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486052  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28545756  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aKurtoic, Sarah Iva.10aDiscovery and Engineering of Non-native Photoenzymatic Asymmetric Transformations. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a139 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Hyster, Todd K.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aBiocatalysis, the use of biological systems or their components to catalyze synthetic processes, is a powerful tool in organic chemistry for the synthesis of valuable compounds. Enzymes are attractive catalysts due to their exceptional selectivities, high turnover numbers and mild reaction conditions. However, enzymes are frequently perceived as highly specific catalysts with a limited scope of reactivity, precluding their general use in organic synthesis. In the first chapter, I outline my work in using external photocatalysts to activate non-natural radical-mediated ketoreductase reactivity in flavin-dependent ene-reductases, demonstrating that biocatalysts have potential for reactivity beyond their natural mechanisms. Among all of their catalytic advantages, it is their inherent evolvability that distinguishes enzymes from all other catalysts. The dramatic decrease in the price of DNA sequencing, novel tools in bioinformatics, high-throughput screening processes, and computer modeling have created boundless opportunities in biocatalysis by enabling researchers to develop enzymes that catalyze unnatural reactions efficiently. Enzymes that exhibit substrate promiscuity, the ability to accept an unnatural substrate, or catalytic promiscuity, the ability to catalyze an unnatural reaction, can be optimized for the desired transformation by employing an accelerated, in vitro version of Darwinian evolution, called directed evolution. By introducing mutations via random mutagenesis, site-directed mutagenesis or site-saturation mutagenesis, an enzyme can be engineered to improve its thermostability, increase tolerance to organic solvents, expand substrate specificity, increase enantioselectivity and catalyze unnatural transformations. While protein-engineering methods are well established, there is currently no general method for engineering enzymes that require photoirradiation. The second chapter of this dissertation outlines my work in developing a method for engineering photoenzymes to improve quantum yield efficiency in a radical-mediated asymmetric hydroalkylation.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aChemistry. 4aOrganic chemistry.  aBiocatalysis  aFlavoenzymes  aPhotochemistry  aPhotoenzymatic  aPhotoredox  aProtein engineering  a0485  a049020aPrinceton University.bChemistry.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854575603393nam a2200457   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002600131245008000157260005800237300001100295500007800306500003600384502004800420506006900468506005900537520181500596590002302411650002302434650002502457650002502482653001402507653002202521653002902543653001902572653001902591653001902610690000902629690000902638690000902647710003802656773005102694790000902745791001002754792000902764793001202773856015002785AAI2854587420220920004314.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106505  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28545874  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aPipal, Robert Wesley.10aMethods for C–C and C–N Bond Formation Via Metallaphotoredox Catalysis. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a224 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: MacMillan, David W.

These molecules have a wide variety of important applications, spanning pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, fragrances, and polymers. Through the merger of photoredox and transition metal catalysis, our group has shown over the last decade that numerous attractive bond disconnections can be accessed via photocatalytic generation of alkyl radicals and activated transition metal catalysts. Moreover, due to the facile nature of visible-light activation and its unique reactivity, metallaphotoredox catalysis has witnessed broad utility in radiochemical and biological applications, among others.Described herein are methods and applications of this metallaphotoredox platform. The second chapter of this thesis details a collaboration with Merck and the University of Pennsylvania for the development of a metallaphotoredox-catalyzed radiolabeling strategy. This unified and general approach allows for the installation of (radio)isotope-bearing methyl groups for applications in PET radioligand discovery. In the third chapter, a dual copper photoredox-catalyzed deoxygenative amination strategy is disclosed, effectively harnessing native and abundant alcohols as diverse alkylating reagents for C(sp3)–N bond formation. Chapter four outlines the ongoing collaboration with Janssen, delineating the late-stage peptide functionalization of alcohol-containing amino acid residues via deoxygenative C–C bond formation. Lastly, following a serendipitous discovery from the study detailed in chapter four, a mild and weakly basic dual nickel photoredox-catalyzed arylation of N-heterocycles was examined and is described in chapter five.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aOrganic chemistry. 4aInorganic chemistry. 4aMolecular chemistry.  aCatalysis  aOrganic chemistry  aOrganometallic chemistry  aPhotocatalysis  aPhotochemistry  aRadiochemistry  a0490  a0488  a043120aPrinceton University.bChemistry.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854587403183nam a2200385   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002000131245010100151260005800252300001100310500007800321500002700399502004800426506005900474520186400533590002302397650001902420653002302439653001502462653001402477690000902491690000902500690000902509710003802518773005102556790000902607791001002616792000902626793001202635856015002647AAI2854758320220920004314.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106574  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28547583  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aBaranek, Bruno.10aEconomics of Public Procurement: Analyses of Corruption and Collusion Using Structural Modeling. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a235 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Kastl, Jakub.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aPublic procurement is one of the most critical aspects of government spending, accounting for roughly one-third of all government spending or 12% of GDP. My dissertation consists of three chapters that examine the economics of public procurement. This dissertation applies modern economic tools such as structural modeling, causal inference, and machine learning to study the most important issues of this market.In Chapter 1, I study the behavior of government agencies and its implication for the optimal design of public procurement. I develop a model that measures the incentives of government agencies and quantifies inefficiencies. Using data from the Czech Republic, I show that government agencies behave inefficiently due to corruption, under-investment into the quality of projects, and lack of information.  A better market design that takes these inefficiencies into account could significantly lower government expenditures. In Chapter 2, we study a particular channel of inefficient behavior- favoritism towards politically connected firms. We create an extensive database of links between political parties and companies and show that politically connected firms deliver a large share of government contracts. Such connections then lead to unequivocally bad procurement outcomes. Prices rise, and quality does not.  We show that increased monitoring likely mitigates this issue.In Chapter 3, we develop a novel tool how to detect collusion in public procurement. Using data from a new E-procurement platform in Ukraine, we use repeated interactions of companies to detect networks of colluding firms. We verify on a large sample of prosecuted companies that our novel approach is very good at detecting companies that were indeed prosecuted for collusion. However, we also show that authorities never detected a large number of collusive rings.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPublic policy.  aPublic procurement  aCorruption  aCollusion  a0501  a0511  a063020aPrinceton University.bEconomics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854758303751nam a2200433   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002200131245009800153260005800251300001100309500007800320500004800398502004800446506005900494520224600553590002302799650003002822650001302852650002302865653000902888653002802897653000902925653002702934653003702961690000902998690000903007690000903016710005103025773005103076790000903127791001003136792000903146793001203155856015003167AAI2854790320220920004314.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486168  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28547903  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aChung, Yoon Jang.10aUltra-High-Quality GaAs and AlAs Two-Dimensional Electron Systems via Molecular Beam Epitaxy. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a147 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Shayegan, Mansour;Pfeiffer, Loren.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis work summarizes how to prepare high-quality GaAs and AlAs two-dimensional electron systems (2DESs) via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). At the time of writing this thesis samples grown using the methods provided here hold world-record results for mobility in both GaAs and AlAs 2DESs. This was achieved by optimization of sample design and systematic reduction of impurities in the structure. In the first few chapters, the working principles of electron transfer in the process of forming a 2DES in AlAs and GaAs quantum wells (QWs) is established. We show that AlAs 2DESs can be prepared in a fashion analogous to that of modulation-doped GaAs 2DESs. Moreover, we elaborate on how the more sophisticated doping-well structure, commonly used for ultra-high-mobility samples, works. Several experimental parameters are tuned in the doped region and their impact on the resultant 2DES density is discussed. Finally, we also demonstrate a heterostructure design that allows the preparation of high-quality, high-density GaAs 2DESs at elevated hydrostatic pressures. The new scheme suppresses the reduction of electron density as a function of pressure by more than a factor of 3. The latter chapters discuss impurities incorporated during the MBE growth of GaAs and AlAs. We start off by devising a strategy to evaluate the cleanliness of our source material. Because the sensitivity of conventional analysis tools such as secondary ion mass spectrometry is too low to probe the amount of impurities in ultra-high-quality GaAs samples, we use the mobility of a specially designed GaAs 2DES as a metric for cleanliness. The main idea here is to exploit the surface segregation of impurities on the growth front, explained in finer detail in the main text. With the cleanliness being quantifiable, we systematically purified our source material until no significant improvement could be observed by offline bakes. This soft limit on sample cleanliness can be lifted by improving the vacuum in our MBE chamber, which we achieve by implementing additional cryogenic cold plates in the growth space. Under the best conditions of source purity and vacuum, we were able to grow samples that demonstrate the highest electron mobilities in the world.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aCondensed matter physics. 4aPhysics. 4aMaterials science.  aAlAs  aFractional quantum hall  aGaAs  aMolecular beam epitaxy  aTwo-dimensional electron systems  a0611  a0794  a060520aPrinceton University.bElectrical Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854790303703nam a2200373   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100003000131245005000161260005800211300001100269500007800280500002700358502004800385506006900433506005900502506006700561520229900628590002302927650003202950653003602982653002503018690000903043710003603052773005103088790000903139791001003148792000903158793001203167856015003179AAI2854820320220920004315.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486076  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28548203  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aRickard, Matthew William.10aProbability: A Literary History, 1479–1700. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a267 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Smith, Nigel.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThe following dissertation is a literary history of probability in the northern renaissance. Before the mathematics of probability was discovered in the 1650s, the concept belonged to the arts of discourse: rhetoric, dialectic, and the methods of interpretation cultivated throughout the period. Probability, for humanists, referred to the beliefs that literature is supposed to inspire in its readers, from the persuasiveness of arguments advanced for the purpose of moral instruction to the persuasiveness of plots, characters, and entire fictions. I show how the various conceptions of probability were brought together in the renaissance classroom and then, through a series of institutional reforms, how they were disentangled. At the beginning of the period, humanists treated the probability of narrative as a special case of the probability of inferences in general, but as their pedagogy adapted to the reality of classroom instruction, they came to see the former as distinct from the latter. Narratives are probable, humanists began to say, insofar as they are typical: poetry is not a set of inferences that may be true or false with some degree of certainty, but rather a representation of the very worlds in which inferences make sense. Such a change cleared the ground for the mathematization of probability in the seventeenth century; it also helped to clarify literary-critical notions like verisimilitude. The literary history of probability therefore sheds light on why we have come to think that the beliefs produced by imaginative literature differ in kind from the beliefs produced by the other arts and sciences.Chapter One explains how poetry was used to teach probability via Rudolph Agricola’s De inventione dialectica. Chapter Two argues that the recovery of Aristotle’s Poetics compromised Philip Sidney’s rhetorical and dialectical account of probability, and Chapter Three argues that the failure of the republican experiment led to John Milton’s transformative critique of the arts course as a whole. The conclusion turns to the correspondence between Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat, where the mathematics of probability was discovered, in order to suggest that they too understood their work as a reaction against the imperatives of literary culture.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aBritish & Irish literature.  aLiterary history of probability  aNorthern renaissance  a059320aPrinceton University.bEnglish.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854820303886nam a2200433   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100003000131245010100161260005800262300001100320500007800331500003300409502004800442506006900490506005900559520234700618590002302965650002202988650002303010653001203033653002003045653002403065653002703089653002503116653001603141690000903157690000903166710003603175773005103211790000903262791001003271792000903281793001203290856015003302AAI2854826820220920004315.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486144  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28548268  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMcMahon, Madeline Claire.10aShepherding a Church in Crisis: Religious Life, Governance, and Knowledge in Early Modern Italy. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a511 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Grafton, Anthony T.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe sixteenth-century Catholic Church was a church in crisis. In the years following the Council of Trent, it was also a church charged with intense optimism. Ecclesiastical leaders were confident that cultural and religious changes were not only possible, but could be precisely directed. The Council tasked the church’s bishops with the burden of carrying out reform, and in so doing, rewrote their job description. Episcopacy was an ancient institution that had to be reimagined for a radically changed present. This dissertation traces the history of an idea, episcopacy, as it was embodied by Italian bishops who, particularly in the generation after the Council, sought out new strategies and information to reconcile competing historical, legal, and liturgical traditions. The dissertation traces a cohort of bishops, connected by a dense network of correspondence: a Catholic republic of letters. Each bishop’s work was the product of many hands. Using a wide range of archival and printed sources, I show that the story of Counter-Reformation bishops is the history of a broader ecclesiastical culture that underwent drastic change—a culture that bishops themselves consciously sought to shape even as they were embedded in it.Methodologically, this dissertation makes a case for including administrative practices and religious devotion as part of intellectual history. Bishops were scholars as well as religious administrators: their research, for instance, on late antique liturgical practices, could be made into reality in cathedral and parish church prayers and devotions. These reforms, for their part, inspired new inquiries of research. Finally, the central question of this dissertation—how bishops knew to pray, govern, or create archives during the ecclesiastical free-for-all following the Council of Trent—has broader implications. Epistemology in the early modern period was closely bound up with authority—the auctoritas of canonical texts, of legal precedents for jurisdiction, and of course that of authorities like bishops themselves. To investigate how bishops made epistemological judgments, often on the very sources for their knowledge about being a bishop, cuts to the heart of important debates about the creation and control of knowledge in both early modern Catholicism and early modern Europe.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aEuropean history. 4aReligious history.  aBishops  aCatholic Church  aCounter-reformation  aInformation management  aKnowledge production  aReformation  a0335  a032020aPrinceton University.bHistory.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854826803230nam a2200457   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002800131245007000159260005800229300001100287500007800298500004700376502004800423506006900471506005900540520169300599590002302292650001402315650002502329650002802354653001402382653001102396653001002407653001002417653002502427653001502452690000902467690000902476690000902485710003702494773005102531790000902582791001002591792000902601793001202610856015002622AAI2854836020220920004315.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106680  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28548360  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aFaulkner, Rebecca Lynn.10aMuhammad Iqbal and the Meanings of South Asian Islamic Modernism. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a194 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Zaman, Muhammad Q.;Marmon, Shaun.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  a“Muhammad Iqbal and the Meanings of South Asian Islamic Modernism” focuses on a highly influential South Asian Islamic modernist’s moral reasoning on key debates like those on the nature of good governance, economic justice, and the use of foundational texts in reformist thought. British Indian poet-philosopher Muhammad Iqbal (d.1938) argues for dynamic, vital remaking of the self and the community through his poetry and prose in Urdu, Persian, and English. Iqbal’s work intervenes in a crucial moment in the history of South Asia, declaring the need for a new understanding of Muslim life in light of what he felt was a pivotal—opportune as well as desperate—moment for reviving Islam and the Muslim community on the cusp of the Partition of India. I use this work to explore the ways in which conditions of domination, for example that of colonial India, affect the imagination of good governance. I also analyze the relationship between economic and religious framings of moral reasoning in the pursuit of just economic conditions. Finally, I demonstrate that debates over the use and interpretation of foundational texts show a wide range of Muslim scholars participating in tradition so that the shared, co-constituted intellectual history can come to the forefront. Politics, economics, and religious reform are examples of fields in which Iqbal envisions a future for moral reasoning, and these examples stand against existing scholarship on the meaning of religion and place of moral reasoning in modernity. I argue that Iqbal’s work offers an opportunity to challenge the scholarly narrative toward an expanded understanding of moral possibilities in modernity.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aReligion. 4aSouth Asian studies. 4aPhilosophy of religion.  aEconomics  aHadith  aIqbal  aIslam  aPolitical philosophy  aSouth asia  a0318  a0322  a063820aPrinceton University.bReligion.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854836003572nam a2200433   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002600131245014100157260005800298300001100356500007800367500004000445502004800485506005900533520199600592590002302588650002902611650002602640650002302666653002702689653002702716653002402743653001602767653002302783690000902806690000902815690000902824710006402833773005102897790000902948791001002957792000902967793001202976856015002988AAI2854839220220920004316.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107090  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28548392  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aRistroph, Kurt David.10aPolymeric Nanocarriers for the Delivery of Ionizable Therapeutics: Formulation, Internal Structure, and Large-Scale Process Development. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a300 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Prud'homme, Robert Krafft.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe efficient encapsulation of water-soluble biopharmaceuticals (‘biologics’) into micro- and nano-delivery vehicles is essential for their therapeutic success as antibiotics, vaccines, and gene therapies. Encapsulation of biologics using liposomes or water-in-oil-in-water emulsions have struggled to achieve commercial success because they suffer from inefficient encapsulation and poor scalability. The few commercial successes rely heavily on the drug’s specific chemical properties; therefore, the lessons from one formulation are rarely generalizable to other biologics. This variability has hampered the field’s ability to develop methodologies for encapsulating biologics. The result is a patchwork approach for formulation and scaleup that suffers from inefficiencies in (i) independently controlling targets such as vehicle size and charge, payload ratios and loading, drug release rate, and encapsulation efficiency, and (ii) processing at scale. Changing a single target midway through formulation can require restarting the process development.This dissertation describes work aimed at improving the pipeline from drug substance (unformulated biologic) to drug product (formulation at scale) through the development of a nanoformulation strategy applicable across several classes of therapeutics that allows broad control over the targets described above. This research examines (1) the combination of solubility engineering and particle formulation techniques to efficiently encapsulate biologics and water-soluble small molecule drugs into nanocarriers with high loadings; (2) the design and manipulation of internal liquid crystalline structures to control drug release; and (3) the colloidal dynamics in these systems to develop novel large-scale nanocarrier processing operations. Therapeutics formulated and used herein include ecumicin (an antitubercular peptide), polymyxin B (an antimicrobial peptide), and OZ439 and lumefantrine (antimalarial small molecules).  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPharmaceutical sciences. 4aChemical engineering. 4aMaterials science.  aPolymeric nanocarriers  aIonizable therapeutics  aProcess development  aFormulation  aInternal structure  a0572  a0542  a079420aPrinceton University.bChemical and Biological Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854839203880nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001500131245006300146260005800209300001100267500007800278500002600356502004800382506005900430520251900489590002303008650002903031650002603060650002203086653002603108653003503134690000903169690000903178690000903187710004503196773005103241790000903292791001003301792000903311793001203320856015003332AAI2854841220220920004316.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106765  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28548412  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aSeff, Ari.10aLearning-Aided Design with Structured Generative Modeling. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a117 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Adams, Ryan.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aHumans exhibit a remarkable ability to design new tools and systems for solving problems. At the heart of this capability lies a rich suite of evolved pattern recognition modules, enabling the reuse and modification of previously existing solutions. Machine learning offers the intriguing possibility of automatically capturing the patterns that arise in various design domains, in particular via generative modeling. By leveraging the general tool of distribution approximation over data, we may hope to computationally encode common design patterns, leading to applications that enable more efficient workflows in engineering, design, and even scientific discovery.But this promising route faces challenges. Integral to the above fields are discrete domains, such as molecules and graphs. In contrast to the Euclidean spaces where generative modeling has recently thrived (e.g., images), discrete domains often exhibit irregular structure, strict validity constraints, and non-canonical representations, presenting unique challenges to modeling. In addition, machine learning as applied to engineering still lacks maturity, and as a result there is a need for curated datasets, benchmarks, and shared pipelines.First, we discuss a novel generative model for discrete domains, known as reversible inductive construction. Building off of generative interpretations of denoising autoencoders, the model employs a Markov chain where transitions are restricted to a set of local operations that both preserve validity and avoid marginalization over a potentially large space of construction histories. Next, we introduce SketchGraphs, a dataset and processing pipeline that contains millions of real-world computer-aided design (CAD) sketches paired with their original geometric constraint graphs. Unlike previously available CAD data, explicit supervision is provided regarding the designer-imposed geometric relationships between primitives, making the typically latent construction operations directly accessible. Lastly, we present Vitruvion, a model that is trained to autoregressively generate CAD sketches as a sequence of primitives and constraints. Generations from the model may be directly imported, solved, and edited in standard CAD software according to downstream design tasks. In addition, we condition the model on various contexts, including partial sketches (primers) and images of hand-drawn sketches. Evaluation demonstrates the potential for this approach to aid the mechanical design workflow.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aArtificial intelligence. 4aComputer engineering. 4aComputer science.  aLearning-aided design  aStructured generative modeling  a0800  a0984  a046420aPrinceton University.bComputer Science.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854841203970nam a2200469   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002200131245010800153260005800261300001100319500007800330500004900408502004800457506006900505506005900574520231600633590002302949650002102972650001602993650001603009650002903025653001803054653002803072653002403100653002703124653002503151690000903176690000903185690000903194690000903203710004703212773005103259790000903310791001003319792000903329793001203338856015003350AAI2854847020220920004316.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107076  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28548470  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aBauchner, Joshua.14aThe Lives of the Mind: Scientific Concept and Everyday Experience from Psychophysics to Psychoanalysis. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a409 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Burnett, D.

It centers on the lives of two figures, the physicist Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801–1887) and the physician Josef Breuer (1842–1925), and their major scientific contributions: Fechner’s psychophysics, an “exact science of the relations between body and soul,” and Breuer’s “talking cure,” a method for removing hysterical symptoms and attendant explanatory theory of their psychogenesis. The dissertation approaches the mind-body relation as subject and object of their lives; they pursued this ineffable relationship in adjoined contexts, vocational and personal, rendering it graspable in the idiom of each: scientific concepts in the vocational and everyday experiences in the personal. For Fechner, these were the threshold and taking a walk, and for Breuer, balance and having a conversation.Part I deals with Fechner and psychophysics. Chapter 2 analyzes how the concept of the threshold was the keystone for the new science, leading to its famous logarithmic relation of stimulus and sensation and a new view of God and the universe. Chapter 3 turns to his everyday walks, thickly describing three modes of walking as they stepped through the major conjunctures of psychophysics. Part II centers on Breuer’s encounter with Bertha Pappenheim, the patient later known as Anna O. who coined the “talking cure.” Chapter 4 considers the type of talk—centered on the self—common to duos such as Pappenheim and Breuer, as it grew from and struggled against Viennese conversational culture. Chapter 5 connects the psychical balance reached via the “talking cure” to Breuer’s physiological investigations of the inner ear and the sense of balance, framed by the personal balance between patient and physician.Against the backdrop of the rising Germanophone research university and professionalizing laboratory science, my account meets the unending complexity of both the mind-body relation and the daily demands of the scientific life. In so doing, I show exactly how the life of the mind really worked: in the minute construction and transit of scientific concepts and in the mundane but variegated repetition of daily experiences.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aScience history. 4aPhysiology. 4aPsychology. 4aExperimental psychology.  aEveryday life  aExperimental physiology  aHistory of medicine  aMind-body relationship  aScience and religion  a0585  a0621  a0623  a071920aPrinceton University.bHistory of Science.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854847004315nam a2200433   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001900131245009600150260005800246300001100304500007800315500002800393502004800421506005900469520281300528590002303341650002803364650002203392650002603414653002603440653002603466653002403492653002003516653002603536690000903562690000903571690000903580710005103589773005103640790000903691791001003700792000903710793001203719856015003731AAI2854850520220920004317.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107007  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28548505  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aJia, Hongyang.10aDesigning Computing Systems Based on Unconventional Technologies for Hardware Acceleration. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a175 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Verma, Naveen.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aHardware specialization is being widely adopted to address the energy and throughput limitations in a range of applications. However, two critical challenges are: (1) degraded programmability; and (2) bottlenecks posed by memory accessing and data movement. This thesis investigates unconventional technologies for computation, enabling unconventional accelerator architectures and associated programmability and physical-design tradeoffs, to overcome these challenges. This employs co-design at the circuit, architectural, and software levels, applied to custom integrated-circuit (IC) prototypes to validate the cross-layer implications. First, the challenge of programmability is explored through opportunities enabled by approximate computing. Accelerator programmability is enhanced by adopting the code-synthesis framework of genetic-programming (GP), which approximates computations from high level specifications (input-output pairs), by using highly structured models of computation, which, in turn, enable accelerator specialization for energy efficiency. A programmable heterogeneous platform for sensor inference is demonstrated, including: a 130nm CMOS IC, integrating a CPU, fixed-function classification accelerator, and programmable feature-extraction accelerator; and a compiler flow for code generation and approximation-aware model training.Next, the challenge of memory accessing and data movement is explored through mixed-signal in-memory computing (IMC), which amortizes accessing of raw bits into accessing of a computational result over all bits in a memory column. This fundamentally increases signal dynamic range, instating an energy/throughput-vs.-SNR tradeoff. A recent approach to high-SNR IMC is exploited to form robust abstractions of the computations, required for architectural integration and software-level interfacing. A programmable heterogeneous processor is demonstrated, including: a 65nm CMOS IC, integrating a CPU, near-memory-computing digital accelerator, and bit-scalable IMC accelerator; and associated programming model and software libraries for neural-network training and mapping. Finally, an architecture and application-mapping algorithms are explored to enable scalability of IMC platforms, especially addressing memory-system energy and latency required for virtualization of IMC hardware. An arrayed dataflow architecture is designed with integrated microarchitectural support for efficient and scalable scheduling and execution of computations for diverse neural-network models. A reconfigurable IMC platform is demonstrated, including: a 16nm CMOS IC, integrating a 4x4 array of IMC modules and scalable network-on-chip; and application-mapping algorithms and toolchain, optimizing energy-efficiency and throughput at the IMC hardware design point.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aElectrical engineering. 4aComputer science. 4aComputer engineering.  aApproximate Computing  aHardware Acceleration  aIn-Memory Computing  aProgrammability  aScalable Architecture  a0544  a0984  a046420aPrinceton University.bElectrical Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854850504205nam a2200457   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100003200131245009600163260005800259300001100317500007800328500003100406502004800437506006900485506005900554520265100613590002303264650001703287650002703304650002203331653001603353653001003369653001403379653001403393653001403407653001003421690000903431690000903440690000903449710004803458773005103506790000903557791001003566792000903576793001203585856015003597AAI2854859120220920004317.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486281  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28548591  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aShahi, Kimia Rose Shahrokh.10aMargin, Surface, Depth: Picturing the Contours of the Marine in Nineteenth-Century America. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a452 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: DeLue, Rachael Z.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation uncovers the surprisingly uncertain relationships between seeing and knowing that shaped how seacoasts were pictured, mapped, and imagined in the United States in the mid-through-late nineteenth-century. During these decades of imperial and settler-colonial expansion, technological modernization, and proliferating modes of transoceanic exchange, efforts to observe, delineate, and describe coasts, coastal phenomena, and their relationships to both sea and land took on new and urgent stakes. Situating period techniques of visual representation associated with both art and science within a broader field of knowledge practice and theory, I demonstrate how coastlines’ material and perceptual conditions challenged conventional relationships between observation and representation across a range of mediums used to produce and transmit visual knowledge about space, territory, and nature, including painting, cartography, drawing, watercolor, and scientific illustration. By elucidating the ways in which knowledge about seacoasts was conceptualized, mediated, and contested across these spheres of production, I offer an expanded and reoriented account, in both spatial and disciplinary terms, of nineteenth-century formulations of landscape, territory, geography, and their cultural politics within, at, and beyond the fluctuating boundaries of the nation itself. This dissertation’s four chapters examine how a selection of period artists, surveyors, scientists, and writers sought to picture shorelines from different physical and conceptual vantage points. I trace how artists such as Martin Johnson Heade (1819–1904), William Trost Richards (1833–1905), and Edward Moran (1829–1901) tested conventions of genre, facture, and truth-to-nature in response to the properties of water, estuaries, and underwater phenomena. Investigating maps, illustrations, and technical manuals produced by the U.S. Coast Survey and within a transnational cohort of oceanographers, I demonstrate how the ever-changing shape of shorelines and the elusive nature of subaqueous terrains challenged ideologies of scientific accuracy, state power, and cartographic knowledge. I argue that together, these case-studies reveal how new forms of skepticism towards vision and related conceptions of truth, realism, accuracy, and illusion, long considered signposts of emerging modes of visual modernity within the long nineteenth century, took on distinctive epistemological, pictorial, and spatial stakes alongshore. They attest to coastlines’ formative roles within modernizing histories of geography, empire, vision, and objectivity.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aArt history. 4aEnvironmental studies. 4aAmerican history.  aCartography  aCoast  aCoastline  aGeography  aLandscape  aWater  a0377  a0477  a033720aPrinceton University.bArt and Archaeology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854859103945nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002900131245008600160260005800246300001100304500007800315500003100393502004800424506006900472506005900541520249200600590002303092650003203115653003603147653001503183653001903198653001903217653002503236690000903261710003603270773005103306790000903357791001003366792000903376793001203385856015003397AAI2854859620220920004317.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486014  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28548596  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aCrandell, Caitlin Elise.10aInkblot Mirrors: On the Metareferential Mode and 19th Century British Literature. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a207 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Johnson, Claudia.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aInkblot Mirrors: On the Metareferential Mode and 19th Century British Literature, argues that we have been reading metatextuality the wrong way. Critics interested in the self-referentiality of texts have turned almost exclusively to particular historical periods and genres in order to substantiate their claims. Scholars of so-called ‘narcissistic narratives,’ ‘self-conscious novels,’ or metafictions gravitate towards early novelists (from Quixote to Sterne) and postmodernist fiction writers (Nabokov, Calvino, Perec), but overlook much else. Dispensing with these strictures, “Inkblot Mirrors” captures and more holistically describes the diverse phenomenon that I define as the metareferential mode by cutting across the expectations typically held of periods and genres in order to capture the continuities that have been lost in their division from one another. Eschewing such isolating boundaries, this modal approach to metareferentiality encompasses the gamut of outer form and inner content, genre and ethos, in order to account for the diverse texts that highlight their own textuality, materiality, and made-ness. Furthermore, the metareferential mode offers a new way of thinking about literary theory, specifically the smaller and less ostentatious moments of literary-philosophical reflection that crop up in the texts themselves rather than in paratexts or critical commentaries. This project takes as its case study a motley crew of 19th-century British texts to demonstrate the pervasiveness and theoretical richness of the metareferential mode: Scott replaces his typical historical sources with fabricated counterfactual events in order to demonstrate limitations of a strict opposition between fiction and history that undergirds the genre; Carlyle transforms the bildungsroman from plot structure into a more pervasive linguistic quality that enacts the development of the reader through a purposefully difficult battle towards comprehension; Browning ventriloquizes nine speakers and also himself, creating an alternative definition of the dramatic monologue that expands what it is to be an artist; Eliot abandons her usual omniscient narrator in her final work and offers Theophrastus Such as a kind of rebuttal against the supposed superiority and objectivity of the realist mode. Decentering critical practices, “Inkblot Mirrors” offers a new rubric for examining the metareferential qualities of any text within the 19th century and beyond.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aBritish & Irish literature.  a19th century British literature  aAuthorship  aMetatextuality  aSelf-reference  aVictorian literature  a059320aPrinceton University.bEnglish.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854859603447nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002700131245008700158260005800245300001100303500007800314500002700392502004800419506005900467520196100526590002302487650002102510650002702531650001302558653001602571653001602587653001402603653002002617653001502637653001702652690000902669690000902678690000902687710006402696773005102760790000902811791001002820792000902830793001202839856015002851AAI2854866820220920004317.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106543  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28548668  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aCarrillo, Francisco J.10aModeling Multiphase Flow Through and Around Multiscale Deformable PorousMaterials. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a229 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Bourg, Ian C.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aDetailed understanding of the coupling between fluid flow and solid deformation in porous media is crucial for the development biomedical devices and novel energy technologies relating to a wide range of geological and biological processes. Well established models based on poroelasticity theory exist for describing coupled fluid-solid mechanics. However, these models are not adapted to describe systems with multiple fluid phases or “hybrid-scale” systems containing both solid-free regions and porous matrices. To address this problem, we present a novel computational fluid dynamics approach based on a unique set of volume-averaged partial differential equations that asymptotically approach the Navier-Stokes Volume-of-Fluid equations in solid-free-regions and Biot’s Poroelasticity Theory in porous regions. Unlike existing multiscale multiphase solvers, it can match analytical predictions of capillary, relative permeability, and gravitational effects at both the pore and Darcy scales. Through careful consideration of interfacial dynamics and extensive benchmarking, we show that the resulting model accurately captures the strong two-way coupling that is often exhibited between multiple fluids and deformable porous media during processes such as swelling, compression, cracking, and fracturing. The versatility of the approach is illustrated through studies that 1) quantified the effects of microporosity on sedimentary rock permeability, 2) identified the governing non-dimensional parameters that predict capillary and viscous fracturing in porous media, 3) characterised the effects of cracking on hydraulic fracture formation, and 4) described wave absorption and propagation in poroelastic coastal barriers. The approach’s open-source numerical implementation “hybridBiotInterFoam”, effectively marks the extension of computational fluid dynamics simulation packages into deformable, multi-phase, multiscale porous systems.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aFluid mechanics. 4aComputational physics. 4aGeology.  aBiot theory  aDeformation  aFractures  aMultiphase flow  aMultiscale  aPorous media  a0204  a0216  a037220aPrinceton University.bChemical and Biological Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854866802965nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002600131245009700157260005800254300001100312500007800323500002900401502004800430506006900478506005900547520139100606590002301997650002002020650002602040650001802066653002002084653001802104653002602122653001702148653002202165690000902187690000902196690000902205710006402214773005102278790000902329791001002338792000902348793001202357856015002369AAI2854897120220920004318.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486229  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28548971  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLalwani, Makoto Ajit.10aDynamic and Modular Control of Microbial Chemical and Protein Production Using Optogenetics. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a243 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Avalos, Jose L.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aMetabolic engineering aims to maximize production of valuable compounds using cells as biological catalysts. When incorporating engineered pathways into host organisms, an inherent conflict is presented between maintenance of cellular health and generation of products. This challenge has been addressed through various modalities of dynamic control: decoupling growth from production via two-phase fermentations and autoregulation of pathways to optimize product formation. Optogenetics offers even greater potential for metabolic engineering through user-mediated open-loop control. Here, we explore and develop modular optogenetic tools for the model organisms Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In Chapter 2, we develop optogenetic control of the E. coli lac operon, enabling the use of light to replace the prominently used inducer isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for chemical and recombinant protein production. In Chapter 3, we import a heterologous activator-repressor protein pair into S. cerevisiae to develop simultaneously usable signal amplifiers and inverters. Finally, in Chapter 4, we demonstrate the use of optogenetics to manipulate the population dynamics of multi-species co-cultures. These studies validate optogenetics as a promising control modality for metabolic engineering, protein production, and other biotechnological applications.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aBioengineering. 4aChemical engineering. 4aMicrobiology.  aDynamic control  aGene circuits  aMetabolic engineering  aOptogenetics  aSynthetic biology  a0202  a0542  a041020aPrinceton University.bChemical and Biological Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854897104004nam a2200457   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002900131245009900160260005800259300001100317500007800328500003400406502004800440506006900488506005900557520243600616590002303052650002803075650002103103650002003124653001203144653001603156653000903172653001903181653001903200653001003219690000903229690000903238690000903247710004903256773005103305790000903356791001003365792000903375793001203384856015003396AAI2854917420220920004318.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106925  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28549174  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aBalistreri, Alexander E.14aThe Persistence of the Periphery: Domination and Change in the Anatolian-Caucasian Borderland. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a656 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Reynolds, Michael A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation presents a modern political history of Kars, a province located today on Turkey’s border with Armenia. Sharing the fate of contested Eurasian and Middle Eastern borderlands, the region around Kars has experienced an exceptional number of invasions and annexations. In the first decades of the twentieth century alone, it came to be ruled by the Russian and Ottoman Empires, a British occupation, a locally proclaimed Southwest Caucasian Republic, and the Armenian and Turkish Republics. Soviet claims to the region, a foundational moment in the Cold War, accompanied a process of sealing the border, which today remains partly closed.The few scholarly accounts of this complicated history have privileged particular states or population groups. It is true that each change of sovereignty brought widespread trauma for the population, while each new sovereign nourished lofty aspirations for the transformation of its border zone. Nevertheless, this dissertation questions the assumption that handovers in sovereignty represented definite breaks in state-society relations, instead arguing for a broad continuity in the ways various state centers interacted with borderland society. This work describes a contest for authority between central states, borderland elites, and borderland populations whose parameters changed only incrementally across the modern period. Regardless of regime type or titular nationality, states displayed similar motivations, techniques, and justifications for rule at their borders. Likewise, borderland elites and populations relied on a similar tactical repertoire in order to entrench their claim to authority in the borderland against the state.  Drawing on examples from several fields of state-society relations, including land tenure and mobility regimes, this research speaks to broader discussions on comparative state-building in the modern era.This dissertation draws on archival sources collected from Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russia, and the United Kingdom. First, it traces the contest between imperial centers and borderland elites until the twentieth century. The central chapters of the dissertation focus on the first decades of the twentieth century, when borderland populations became a more prominent feature of this contest. The final chapters, meanwhile, examine Turkish administration in Kars and the effects of the closure of the Soviet border.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMiddle Eastern history. 4aRussian history. 4aModern history.  aArmenia  aBorderlands  aKars  aOttoman Empire  aRussian Empire  aState  a0333  a0724  a058220aPrinceton University.bNear Eastern Studies.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854917403001nam a2200349   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001600131245005000147260005800197300001100255500007800266500003100344502004800375506005900423520180500482590002302287650002202310653001402332653001002346690000902356710004502365773005102410790000902461791001002470792000902480793001202489856015002501AAI2854926220220920004318.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486151  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28549262  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLiu, Sixue.10aSublinear Time Algorithms for Graph Problems. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a178 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Tarjan, Robert E.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aProcessing massive graphs is becoming a more-and-more essential task in big-data analysis nowadays. Many graph problems require running time linear in the input size on the traditional RAM model. But linear time is not good enough in many real-life applications. In this thesis, we focus on theoretical analysis of solving fundamental graph problems on practical big-data platforms such as streaming and parallel computation models, with an emphasis on time efficiency and simplicity. In the first part of this thesis, we study the connected components problem in the parallel computation model. Our first result includes several simple parallel algorithms with a state-of-the-art running time, which are significantly easier to implement comparing to the existing ones. Our second result includes simpler algorithms for connected components and spanning forest that are faster than any previous algorithms when the graph has small diameter—which is usually true in many graphs generated from real-life instances—albeit in a much weaker computation model. For the second part of this thesis, we study the graph matching problem. We first give a simple algorithm for approximate bipartite matching on streaming and massively parallel computation models that improve upon the existing ones on the number of passes or space usage. Then we present the first semi-streaming algorithm for exact maximum weight bipartite matching that breaks the linear-pass barrier whenever the graph is not super dense. Our approaches not only leverage the combinatorial properties in the graph, but also reformulate the graph problem and use continuous optimization techniques. We hope the new general techniques developed in this thesis can find further applications in algorithm design emerged in big-data analysis.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aComputer science.  aAlgorithm  aGraph  a098420aPrinceton University.bComputer Science.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854926204409nam a2200505   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002700131245008300158260005800241300001100299500007800310500004400388502004800432506006900480506005900549520269100608590002303299650001903322650001403341650002503355650001803380650001503398653001303413653001503426653004203441653001803483653002503501653004503526690000903571690000903580690000903589690000903598690000903607710004603616773005103662790000903713791001003722792000903732793001203741856015003753AAI2854930420220920004319.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107519  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28549304  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMoore, Rebecca Sydney.10aC.

Prolonged exposure to PA14 results in death and therefore extinction of the population. It has been reported that experiences trigger small RNA based-responses in C. elegans. Here, we identify a novel intergenerational and transgenerational response to P. aeruginosa. When C. elegans encounters PA14 worms become sick and eventually will die if they cannot escape. We found that when worms are exposed to PA14 during the reproductive period, progeny that are laid and hatch on PA14 have two development fates: (1) pre-reproductive arrest (L4 arrest), or (2) post-reproductive diapause (adult reproductive diapause, ARD). This intergenerational-developmental effect is advantageous because the L4-arrested state prolongs the survival of C. elegans undergoing chronic PA14 infection, while the ARD state allows for efficient reproduction when worms locate more nutritious food. In addition to becoming sick during P. aeruginosa exposure worms can learn to avoid PA14 if given the choice between PA14 and its normal laboratory food. We discovered that in addition to learning to avoid PA14, mothers can pass this information on to their progeny for four generations before resuming naive attraction in the fifth. This mechanism requires the piRNA machinery, the COMPASS complex of epigenetic regulators and the ASI sensory neuron. We then discovered that worms can “read” bacterial small RNAs using the canonical RNAi pathway in the intestine, piRNA signaling in the germline, and transcriptional changes in the ASI neuron. The components required for avoidance behavior in the mother are also required in the progeny suggesting we have identified a novel inter-tissue signaling mechanism that conveys bacterial identity in order to promote survival transgenerationally. Finally, we found that the Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposon Cer1 forms viral-like particles in the germline and is required for survival on PA14, for transmitting the avoidance signal from the germline to neurons, and for transgenerational inheritance of pathogen avoidance. Furthermore, we found that transgenerational pathogen avoidance can be horizontally transmitted and transgenerationally inherited in naive worms. These effects are conserved in wild C. elegans isolates suggesting that worms have co-opted a potentially dangerous retrotransposon to help them avoid pathogens and promote transgenerational survival.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aNeurosciences. 4aGenetics. 4aBehavioral sciences. 4aMicrobiology. 4aPathology.  aBehavior  aC. elegans  aIntergenerational Pathogenic Response  aP. aerguinosa  aPathogenic Avoidance  aTransgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance  a0317  a0369  a0602  a0410  a057120aPrinceton University.bMolecular Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854930404132nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100003100131245012900162260005800291300001100349500007800360500005100438502004800489506005900537520252800596590002303124650002103147650002003168650002703188653002803215653001903243653002503262653002603287653001603313653002403329690000903353690000903362690000903371710006503380773005103445790000903496791001003505792000903515793001203524856015003536AAI2854942620220920004319.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486038  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28549426  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aGalea, Christopher Andrew.10aCoherent Microwave Scattering from Laser-Generated Plasma in External Magnetic Field and Weakly Ionized Plasma Environments. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a148 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Shneider, Mikhail N.;Dogariu, Arthur.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aRadar Resonance-Enhanced Multi-Photon Ionization (Radar REMPI) is a remote diagnostic technique which selectively ionizes a gaseous species of interest using a tunable laser to create a REMPI-generated plasma (the “REMPI” part) and probes this plasma via coherent microwave scattering (the “Radar” part) to obtain time-resolved information about the plasma. This dissertation presents a theoretical and experimental investigation of the physics and robustness of Radar REMPI as the diagnostic is extended to new environments (low pressures, magnetic fields, and background plasma) and capabilities (vector magnetic field measurements and remote atomic physics experiments) relevant to plasma propulsion, plasma materials processing, and magnetometry applications. The strengths of Radar REMPI that are useful for these novel environments include: standoff measurement capability, spatial and temporal resolution (on the order of millimeters and nanoseconds respectively), and species-selectivity. The effects of collisions are demonstrated in higher (near atmospheric) pressures via comparison of 0-dimensional kinetic models with experiments, while in lower pressures (< 1 Torr), faster-than-expected decay rates are explained by considering the loss of coherence (decoherence) of the scattered microwaves due to rapid expansion of the laser-generated plasma. Considering the effects of an applied magnetic field led to the discovery of a novel magneto-optical effect: magnetically induced depolarization of the scattered microwaves from the REMPI plasma due to anisotropy in the transport properties of electrons in a magnetic field. This effect introduces a novel capability to Radar REMPI, namely, the standoff measurement of local vector magnetic fields, which would benefit applications involving limited access environments. The introduction of background plasma is shown to result in a substantial increase in ionization in the long-term signal (> 2 μs) after the addition of laser-generated ionization, which can impact some measurement capabilities of Radar REMPI but can also provide increased sensitivity for trace species detection. Lastly, a REMPI scheme using combined femtosecond and picosecond lasers was shown to vary in ionization yield based on the relative polarizations of the two laser pulses, which provides information about the fine structure populations and spin polarization of the excited state and shows the potential use of Radar REMPI to conduct atomic physics experiments remotely.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aApplied physics. 4aPlasma physics. 4aAerospace engineering.  aLaser-generated plasmas  aMagnetic field  aMicrowave scattering  aPolarization of light  aRadar REMPI  aRayleigh scattering  a0215  a0759  a053820aPrinceton University.bMechanical and Aerospace Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854942603617nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100003600131245011100167260005800278300001100336500007800347500005300425502004800478506005900526520207000585590002302655650002302678650002602701650002302727653002002750653001502770653001602785653002702801653001802828653001802846690000902864690000902873690000902882710003902891773005102930790000902981791001002990792000903000793001203009856015003021AAI2854942720220920004319.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106673  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28549427  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMartinez-Higuera, Joel Eduardo.10aMapping Mental Representations of Illegalized Immigrants Across Visual, Evaluative, and Geographic Spaces. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a185 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Todorov, Alexander;Paluck, Elizabeth L.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe United States has been experiencing a widespread nationalist backlash in response to displacement and migration dynamics that has had and will continue to have immediate and dire consequences for immigrants, especially those who are illegalized. To better understand the underlying psychology of this anti-immigrant zeitgeist, I take advantage of recent computational techniques to map mental representations of illegalized immigrants across evaluative, visual, and geographic spaces. In particular, the studies in this dissertation collectively focus on characterizing face representations– what are illegalized immigrants thought to look like and how is illegality visually encoded into these representations? I first present evidence that representations of illegalized immigrants are uniquely racialized through a combination of darker skin tones and threatening expressions compared to other documentation categories (e.g., U.S. citizens or documented immigrants). I then probe the robustness of this initial representation in various ways. One way is by intersecting illegalized immigrants with cross-categorical positionalities (e.g., nationality and economic), showing that the visual features that mark illegality are not static and can shift across social categories. Another way is by mapping variation in how different people represent illegalized immigrants using machine learning techniques, showing there are demographic and geographic clusters of people who hold different understandings of illegalized immigrants. Across the studies, the results consistently show that illegalization and racialization are intimately intertwined in the public’s minds, revealing the racial and visual logics produced by imperial projects used to manage populations within and across U.S. borders. In applying novel techniques to understand perceptions of a neglected population within social psychology, this dissertation ultimately critiques and extends social psychology’s theoretical preoccupations, methodological practices, and their inter-relations.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aSocial psychology. 4aCognitive psychology. 4aPolitical science.  aFace perception  aIllegality  aImmigration  aMental representations  aRacialization  aUnited States  a0451  a0633  a061520aPrinceton University.bPsychology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854942703738nam a2200493   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002100131245010400152260005800256300001100314500007800325500003600403502004800439506006900487506005900556506006700615520201500682590002302697650002302720650001502743650002402758650002602782653001402808653002102822653001902843653002002862653002202882653002502904690000902929690000902938690000902947690000902956710003802965773005103003790000903054791001003063792000903073793001203082856015003094AAI2854944320220920004319.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107038  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28549443  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aChen, Tiffany Q.10aNovel Platforms for Cross-Coupling and Decarboxylative Functionalization via Metallaphotocatalysis. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a346 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: MacMillan, David W.

To address these needs, our group leverages the merger of transition metal catalysis and photocatalysis (i.e., metallaphotocatalysis) toward the development of new coupling and activation platforms. The ability of photocatalysis to selectively activate organic substrates via single electron transfer pathways to generate open-shell species under mild conditions, coupled with transition metal cross-coupling, has led to the development of a diverse and powerful array of synthetic manifolds that enable previously elusive bond disconnections and streamline the synthesis of molecules. Although this field has advanced rapidly in the past decade, the development of novel metallaphotocatalytic methods that broadly enable the coupling of diverse fragments continues to be in high demand. This thesis details several efforts that employ metallaphotocatalysis in the development of novel cross-coupling methods and activation modes. First, Chapter 2 describes a new approach for nickel/photoredox-catalyzed cross-electrophile coupling of activated alkyl chlorides and aryl halides, facilitated by silyl radical-mediated halogen atom abstraction as a key design element. Chapter 3 extends this design element to the activation of C(sp2)–Br bonds which, in combination with dual copper/photoredox catalysis, enables a general protocol for trifluoromethylation of aryl bromides. Finally, Chapter 4 describes a novel ligand-to-copper charge transfer platform that promotes the decarboxylative functionalization of aryl carboxylic acids (a modular and abundant yet recalcitrant class of substrates), rendering a previously inaccessible range of aryl carboxylic acids broadly accessible as adaptive functional handles.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aOrganic chemistry. 4aChemistry. 4aPhysical chemistry. 4aChemical engineering.  aCatalysis  aCopper catalysis  aCross-coupling  aDecarboxylation  aMetallaphotoredox  aPhotoredox catalysis  a0490  a0485  a0542  a049420aPrinceton University.bChemistry.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2854944302354nam a2200373   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100003200131245005600163260005800219300001100277500007800288500003200366502004800398506005900446520108600505590002301591650002301614653001501637653001601652653001601668690000901684690000901693710003701702773005101739790000901790791001001799792000901809793001201818856015001830AAI2864308220220920004320.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486298  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28643082  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aGagliardi, Richard A., III.10aStereotypes and Reputations for Keeping Assurances. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a255 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Yarhi-Milo, Keren.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aAdverse national stereotypes, which often have a racial or ethnic character, prevent states from attaining reputations as assurance keepers. Reputations predict future behavior by explaining past behavior as the result of an actor’s characteristics. Negative stereotypes preclude formation of reputations for keeping assurances because people prefer to preserve their stereotypic preconceptions. To preserve their preconceptions, people explain a negatively stereotyped state’s choice to keep assurances as the result of transient situational factors, and not as the result of characteristics. This leaves intact the state’s reputation as an assurance breaker despite evidence of kept assurances. Only states associated with positive national stereotypes may attain an assurance keeper reputation. The dissertation uses British reputational assessments of the United States and Japan between 1910 and 1931 and an original survey experiment to test the argument. Both case studies depend on extensive archival research conducted at The National Archives in the United Kingdom.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPolitical science.  aAssurances  aReputations  aStereotypes  a0615  a060120aPrinceton University.bPolitics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864308203278nam a2200349   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100003100131245006600162260005800228300001100286500007800297500003200375502004800407506005900455520204800514590002302562653001802585653001602603653002102619690000902640710003802649773005102687790000902738791001002747792000902757793001202766856015002778AAI2864324520220920004320.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106871  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28643245  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aVogler, Maximilian Jochen.10aEssays on Granularity and Machine Learning in Macroeconomics. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a193 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Rogerson, Richard.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation consists of three independent chapters on granularity in macroeconomics and machine learning methods designed to solve the methodological challenges imposed by granular models, i.e. models with many different individual agents, firms or countries.In the first chapter, which is co-authored with Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde, Galo Nuno and George Sorg-Langhans, we develop a deep-learning algorithm to globally solve high-dimensional dynamic programming problems that result from granular macroeconomic models. We evaluate our methodology in a standard neoclassical growth model and then demonstrate its power in two high-dimensional granular applications – a model of dynamic capital allocation and a model of migration and labor mobility.In the second chapter, which is co-authored with Cecile Gaubert and Oleg Itskhoki, we focus on the importance of considering a granular firm distribution for government policy in an international trade setting, highlighting three implications: (i) In antitrust regulation, governments face an incentive to be overly lenient towards domestic mergers in comparative advantage sectors. (ii) In trade policy, targeting individual foreign exporters shifts the burden of tariffs from domestic consumers towards foreign producers. (iii) In industrial policy, while generally suboptimal in a closed economy subsidizing ’national champions’ can be unilaterally welfare improving in an open economy.In the third chapter, I demonstrate the importance of considering granularity at the country level by demonstrating that economic crises drive cross-country migration. I show in an event study setting that net migration caused by the Euro crisis accounts for roughly 21% of all migration from EU countries into Germany between 2010-2019. In addition I highlight three salient facts: (i) This increase is mostly due to inflows rather than outflows. (ii) The migration response evolves gradually and achieves its maximum size only after five years. (iii) There is strong evidence for hysteresis.  aSchool code: 0181.  aDeep learning  aGranularity  aMachine learning  a050120aPrinceton University.bEconomics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864324503464nam a2200385   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002200131245006900153260005800222300001100280500007800291500003700369502004800406506005900454520215300513590002302666650002902689653002002718653002102738653001002759653001202769690000902781690000902790710003802799773005102837790000902888791001002897792000902907793001202916856015002928AAI2864328820220920004320.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486137  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28643288  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aCuddy, Emily Ann.10aEssays on Pharmaceuticals: Firm Competition, Usage, and Pricing. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a168 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Currie, Janet;Ho, Kate.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aPharmaceuticals play a crucial role in the US health care system. My dissertation consists of three chapters that examine the economics of pharmaceutical markets. In particular, I examine how firm competition, physician prescribing decisions, and price dispersion affect US consumers. In Chapter 1, I examine the role of competition in the US generic drug market in the wake of the unprecedented price spikes of the past decade, which have been linked to the collusive conduct of manufacturers. Using unsealed records of the ring’s activity, I analyze how collusion—in combination with other contemporaneous features of the market—affected upstream drug prices by estimating a model of retail drug procurement, wherein generic manufacturers submit bids to supply national pharmacies with their drugs. Estimates suggest that the collusive ring generated billions in surplus for itself over 18 months and, moreover, that the unprecedented backlog of generic drug applications at the Food and Drug Administration in this period exacerbated the situation. In Chapter 2, Janet Currie and I study how initial mental health treatment affects the outcomes of adolescents. Using a large national data base of insurance claims, we find evidence that receiving follow-up mental health treatment in the first three months after an initial episode increases health care costs over the next 24 months. Moreover, these higher costs are entirely accounted for by children who receive treatment that is not consistent with practice guidelines, and especially by those who receive drugs that raise a red-flag. Finally, in Chapter 3, I examine price dispersion in the US over-the-counter drug market. Analysis of weekly sales data over the last decade for over 4,000 drug products suggests that there is widespread price dispersion across the country, even at the granularity of the universal product code. Consistent with recent discussions of health care exceptionalism, I find evidence that much of the dispersion can be explained by preexisting theories of price dispersion, including costly consumer search, store-level amenities, and retail-chain effects.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPharmaceutical sciences.  aPharmaceuticals  aFirm competition  aUsage  aPricing  a0501  a057220aPrinceton University.bEconomics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864328804060nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001800131245010300149260005800252300001100310500007800321500002900399502004800428506005900476520260800535590002303143650002303166653002303189653002503212653002903237653002103266653003303287653002803320690000903348710006403357773005103421790000903472791001003481792000903491793001203500856015003512AAI2864349720220920004320.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106833  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28643497  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aKumar, Vivek.10aPhysics-Based and Data-Driven Methods for Structural Health Monitoring at Fine Spatial Resolution. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a191 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Glisic, Branko.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aStructural health monitoring (SHM) process involves several elements: selection of monitoring strategy, installation \\& management of monitoring system, data management, and closing activities. In the last four decades, each of these processes has attracted considerable attention and we have reached the stage of commercial deployment for long-term monitoring of civil infrastructure. Furthermore, monitoring technologies are consistently being adapted from and exported to domains of mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, archaeology, and geotechnical engineering. Still, one challenging area for civil structure scale of monitoring is design and implementation of sensing technologies to cover large areas while maintaining fine spatial resolution at an affordable cost. Densely instrumenting the structure with point sensors would result in the SHM system cost a significant fraction of the structure's budget which would not be approved by the stakeholders. Distributed fiber-optic sensors provide a relatively affordable solution yet only provide one-dimensional information about the structure. In this dissertation, this gap of affordable sensing technologies for large area monitoring at fine spatial resolution is addressed using traditional sensing technologies such as electrical strain gages (ESG) and ground penetrating radar (GPR). These technologies are mature for assessment of parameters over large areas of structures with fine spatial resolution.Using novel large-area electronics, affordable two-dimensional sensors are demonstrated using ESG while GPR is used as three-dimensional sensor. They are combined with data-driven and physics-based approaches to achieve the goal of large-scale monitoring at finer scales. The data-driven approach includes use of supervised machine learning (ML) models to determine the concrete material properties using GPR scans. ML models are developed using laboratory curated concrete beams and laboratory tested cylinders. These models are used for estimating concrete properties such as density, porosity and compressive strength on the deck of a pedestrian bridge. Physics-based approach includes analytical modeling for a dense array of resistive strain gage sensors for crack identification, i.e., detection, localization, quantification. Algorithms are developed based on these analytical models for crack identification, and verified using laboratory tests and employed on real-life structure.The results pave way for truly affordable and distributed sensing technologies for comprehensive monitoring of structures at finer scales.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aCivil engineering.  aAttribute analysis  aCrack identification  aGround penetrating radar  aMachine learning  aStructural health monitoring  aTwo-dimensional sensing  a054320aPrinceton University.bCivil and Environmental Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864349705278nam a2200457   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002700131245012700158260005800285300001100343500007800354500002800432502004800460506006900508506005900577520363700636590002304273650002604296650001704322650002304339653002004362653002204382653002904404653002404433653001704457653001404474690000904488690000904497690000904506710006404515773005104579790000904630791001004639792000904649793001204658856015004670AAI2864353120220920004321.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486502  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28643531  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aSorli, Jeni Christine.10aElucidation of Chemistry-Structure-Function Relationships in Molecular Semiconductors for Organic Electronic Applications. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a296 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Loo, Yuen-Lin.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aMolecular semiconductors are promising candidates for the active components of organic electronic devices as their optoelectronic properties can be tuned at the onset of synthesis, and they can be incorporated into lightweight, large-area, flexible devices at low costs. Yet, there are numerous challenges associated with molecular semiconductor systems and their commercial implementation, which largely stem from the structural heterogeneities present in polycrystalline thin films that strongly influence charge transport in devices. The microstructure of thin film active layers is dependent on both chemical structure and the processing conditions used. Thus, it is important to develop an understanding for the complex relationships that govern these systems. This thesis explores the development of chemistry-processing-structure-function relationships across multiple length scales in small molecule organic semiconductor systems. First, we explored the relationships between chemical structure and optoelectronic properties through targeted design of coronene derivatives for application in UV-absorbing, visibly transparent solar cells. We calculated the frontier orbital and excited state transition energies of over 350 candidate compounds and used the calculations to screen for promising molecules for synthesis and characterization. From our screening procedure, we selected and synthesized three coronene derivatives for use as donors in organic photovoltaic (OPV) active layers to produce visibly transparent OPVs, and in doing so demonstrated how integrated computational and experimental efforts can accelerate materials design. It is also important to understand how molecular semiconductors pack in the solid-state to elucidate the relationships between solid-state structure and device function. We explored the role of halogenated contorted hexabenzocoronene (cHBC) derivatives on the degradation of organic solar cells during stability testing and find that both fluorinated and chlorinated cHBCs, that start out amorphous as-deposited, crystallize during aging. The crystallization of cHBC derivatives produces gaps at the acceptor-buffer layer interface that hinder charge extraction, which results in the degradation of OPV device performance. We examined how atomistic substitution in the side group of triisopropylsilylethynylpentacene (TIPS-Pn) to produce triisopropylgermanylethynyl-pentacene (TIPGe-Pn), which maintains the size of the side group but increases its electron density, allows TIPGe-Pn to access a much broader structural phase space than TIPS-Pn. This work establishes that the solid-state packing of functionalized acenes depends on both the size of the side group and electron density, which may be tuned with simple atomistic substitutions. Finally, we explored the impact of grain boundaries on the kinetics of polymorphic transformations in a core-chlorinated naphthalene tetracarboxylic diimide. We determined that grain boundaries can lower the energy barrier by initiating polymorphic transformations. This work demonstrates the importance of grain boundaries, which are common in polycrystalline organic semiconductors, not only for their impact on charge transport but also in initiation of polymorphic transformations. Collectively, the work in this thesis highlights the importance of developing robust chemistry-processing-structure-function relationships that can guide material development. We demonstrate methodologies and illuminate concepts that will allow for further optimization and improvement to the performance and stability of organic electronics in the future.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aChemical engineering. 4aEngineering. 4aMaterials science.  aApplied science  aMaterials science  aMolecular semiconductors  aOrganic electronics  aPolymorphism  aSynthesis  a0542  a0794  a053720aPrinceton University.bChemical and Biological Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864353105274nam a2200469   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001300131245006800144260005800212300001100270500007800281500004100359502004800400506005900448520369300507590002304200650002804223650002604251650002504277650002904302653002504331653003404356653002104390653002104411653002204432653002204454690000904476690000904485690000904494690000904503710005104512773005104563790000904614791001004623792000904633793001204642856015004654AAI2864357220220920004321.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106895  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28643572  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLu, Jie.10aEnergy-Efficient Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a148 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Jha, Niraj K;Verma, Naveen.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aPattern-recognition algorithms from the domain of machine learning play a prominent role in embedded sensing systems, in order to derive inferences from sensor data. Very often, such systems face severe energy constraints. The focus of this thesis is on mitigating the energy required for computation, communication, and storage by exploiting various forms of computation algorithms. In the first part of our work, we focus on reducing the computations necessary during linear signal-processing. In order to achieve computation reduction, we consider random projection. Random projection is a form of compression that preserves a similarity metric widely used for pattern recognition is used for computational energy reduction. The form of compression is random projection, and the similarity metric is inner product between source vectors. Given the prominence of random projections within compressive sensing, previous research has explored this idea for application to compressively-sensed signals. We show that random projections can be exploited more generally without compressive sensing, enabling significant reduction in computational energy and avoiding a significant source of error. The approach is referred to as compressed signal processing (CSP). It applies to Nyquist-sampled signals.The second part of our work focuses on dealing with signal processing that may not be linear. We look into approximate computing and its potential as an algorithmic approach to reducing energy. Approximate computing is a broad approach that has recently received considerable attention in the context of inference systems. This stems from the observation that many inference systems exhibit various forms of tolerance to data noise. While some systems have demonstrated significant approximation-vs.-energy knobs to exploit this, they have been applicable to specific kernels and architectures; the more generally available knobs have been relatively weak, resulting in large data noise for relatively modest energy savings (e.g., voltage overscaling, bit precision scaling). In this work, we explore the use of genetic programming (GP) to compute approximate features. Further, we leverage a method that enhances tolerance to feature-data noise through directed retraining of the inference stage. Previous work in GP has shown that it generalizes well to enable approximation of a broad range of computations, raising the potential for broad applicability of the proposed approach. The focus on feature extraction is deliberate because it involves diverse, often highly nonlinear, operations, challenging general applicability of energy-reducing approaches.The third part of our work takes into consideration multi-task algorithms. By exploiting the concept of transfer learning and energy-efficient data show accelerators, we show that the use of convolutional autoencoders can enable various levels of reduction in computational energy and avoid a significant reduction in inference performance when multiple task categories are targeted for obtaining an inference. In order to minimize inference computational energy, a convolutional autoencoder is used for learning a generalized representation of inputs. We consider three scenarios: transferring layers using convolutional autoencoders, transferring layers using convolutional neural networks trained on different tasks, and no layer transfer. We also take into account the performance when transferring only convolutional layers versus when transferring convolutional layers and a fully connected layer.We study our methodologies through validations of their generalizability and through applications using clinical and image data.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aElectrical engineering. 4aComputer engineering. 4aApplied mathematics. 4aArtificial intelligence.  aApproximate learning  aConvolutional neural networks  aEnergy reduction  aMachine learning  aMulti-task images  aTransfer learning  a0544  a0464  a0800  a036420aPrinceton University.bElectrical Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864357204101nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002100131245014900152260005800301300001100359500007800370500004100448502004800489506005900537520262200596590002303218650001503241650001803256650001403274653001703288653001503305653002003320653003303340690000903373690000903382690000903391710003803400773005103438790000903489791001003498792000903508793001203517856015003529AAI2864358820220920004321.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106482  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28643588  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aCaruso, Alessio.10aUncovering New Metalloenzyme-Mediated Chemistry from Nature’s Toolkit: Radical S-Adenosylmethionine Reactions in Natural Product Biosynthesis. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a267 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Seyedsayamdost, Mohammad R.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aCurrently, 50% of all therapeutic agents are linked to a natural product. Recent advancements in DNA sequencing technologies, however, reveal that the vast majority of encoded natural products are undiscovered. Our efforts to identify structurally and functionally new natural products have guided us to Ribosomally-synthesized and post-translationally-modified peptides (RiPPs), an emerging class of natural products that harbor diverse chemical motifs introduced via the action of tailoring enzymes. Specifically, we focus on RiPPs that are modified by unusual metalloenzymes, as these may install yet unknown alterations. Using a novel bioinformatic search strategy, we uncovered an array of unexplored RiPP biosynthetic gene clusters that are quorum sensing-regulated and contain uncharacterized radical S-adenosylmethionine (RaS) metalloenzymes, a diverse protein superfamily capable of catalyzing chemically difficult transformations. Further, our identified RiPP subfamilies are produced by streptococci, a genus of bacteria prevalent in mammalian microbiomes that includes mutualistic, commensal, and pathogenic members.Herein, we investigated several of the identified RiPP subfamilies and found novel transformations which add to the already impressive reaction repertoire of RaS enzymes. In the NxxC subfamily, we found that the RaS enzyme NxxcB installs an intramolecular β-thioether bond onto its substrate peptide, a novel reaction for RaS enzymes. We went on to identify the mature RiPP product of the nxxc operon in Streptococcus equi, which contains two sequential β-thioether macrocycles. We next elucidated the key modification of the QMP subfamily as two sequential α-thioether crosslinks, generating a sactipeptide of the rare type-2 ring topology. Subsequently, we characterized a member of the RRR subfamily and showed the RaS enzyme RrrB installs a macrocyclic carbon-carbon bond. Moreover, we used a combination of computational tools and circular dichroism spectroscopy to identify the chirality of the RaS enzyme-generated stereocenter. Finally, we clarified the detailed mechanism of carbon-carbon bond formation in lysine-tryptophan crosslinking RaS enzymes using isotope labeling studies in conjunction with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our studies revealed an unprecedented crosslinked Lys–Trp radical intermediate, defining a mechanistic paradigm for enzyme-catalyzed carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions. Future investigations of the remaining RaS-RiPP gene clusters and their mature natural products are sure to reveal new chemistries and biological activities.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aChemistry. 4aBiochemistry. 4aGenetics.  aBiosynthesis  aEnzymology  aNatural product  aRadical S-adenosylmethionine  a0485  a0487  a036920aPrinceton University.bChemistry.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864358803461nam a2200457   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002900131245005800160260005800218300001100276500007800287500002900365502004800394506006900442506005900511520193700570590002302507650002302530650002702553650001302580650001902593653001302612653001902625653001802644653002702662690000902689690000902698690000902707690000902716710003702725773005102762790000902813791001002822792000902832793001202841856015002853AAI2864361520220920004321.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106628  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28643615  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aRosenstiel, Leah Sirota.10aCongress, Bargaining, and the Distribution of Grants. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a159 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: A.  aAdvisor: McCarty, Nolan.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aIn this dissertation, I seek to understand how Congress designs federal grant programs and what the consequences of that process are for the effectiveness of these programs. I show how institutional features, such as the committee system and majority rule, interact with the structure of grants-in-aid to influence the policymaking process. In doing so, I speak to the important question of whether Congress is well designed to create to effective policies. I develop a theory of congressional bargaining over the formulas used to allocate grants and test the theory using an original dataset of Senate amendments. The results suggest that congressional rules and political considerations shape, and at times distort, federal grant programs. For instance, I find that legislators design programs to procure additional funding for their states, and states represented by members of key congressional committees disproportionately benefit. Further, I show how coalitions are shaped by the status quo policy and the distribution of population, poverty, and other measures of need across states. Together, these results illustrate how institutional features, such as the committee system and majority rule, influence the policymaking process. Moreover, the results suggest that the congressional committee system combined with legislators' self interests can improve the targeting of federal funding to the areas with the highest need. However, in certain cases, majority and supermajority rules limit committees' abilities to target funding. Finally, I examine the downstream effects of this policymaking process. I show that the additional funding members of key Senate committees are able to procure for their states translates into important policy outcomes. I find that school districts hire more teachers and see an increase in high school completion when their Senators join the Senate committee with jurisdiction over education.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPolitical science. 4aPublic administration. 4aFinance. 4aPublic policy.  aCongress  aFormula Grants  aGrants-in-Aid  aPolitical Institutions  a0615  a0630  a0617  a050820aPrinceton University.bPolitics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864361504247nam a2200457   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001800131245010200149260005800251300001100309500007800320500002800398502004800426506006900474506005900543520269400602590002303296650001303319650002503332650002103357653002103378653001303399653002003412653001103432653002203443653002003465690000903485690000903494690000903503710003603512773005103548790000903599791001003608792000903618793001203627856015003639AAI2864374320220920004322.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106864  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28643743  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aQayyum, Amna.14aThe Demographic State: Population, Global Biopolitics, and Decolonization in South Asia, 1947-71. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a371 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Prakash, Gyan.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aIn 1961 Pakistan became the second country in the world, following India, to enact an official fertility control policy. Over the course of the next decade, by transforming a prior urban, clinical focus into an expansive statewide project of population control, Pakistan emerged as an epicenter for transnational demographic research and practice. In dialogue with a “global population establishment”, Pakistani actors debated effective methods for calculating demographic statistics, while crafting strategies for the mass adoption of particular contraceptive technologies and reshaping socio-cultural norms. These transnational projects of population control also stimulated debate over normative state power, political and economic inequities between East and West Pakistan, and Cold War geopolitics - ultimately shaping protests against Ayub Khan’s authoritarian regime during the late 1960s. Set within the context of two partitions – of British India in 1947 and the Bangladesh War of Liberation in 1971 – this study traces histories of population management to analyze state-making, and unmaking, in East and West Pakistan. It situates Pakistan not simply as a Cold War laboratory, but rather as a critical geography in the production of demographic knowledge and practices. “The Demographic State” argues that postwar regimes of eugenic and Malthusian knowledge were not solely tools of an expanding Cold War era American security apparatus. Drawing on materials from social scientists, medical and public health professionals, women’s welfare activists, bureaucrats, and Islamic modernists, this dissertation examines how intersecting national and transnational currents of population management were crucial in shaping normative understandings of reproduction, religious authority, and development; fashioning practices and technologies of  postcolonial state-making; and instituting racialized and gendered forms of global governance. However, rather than seeing emergent forms of global governance as a powerless web transcending national borders, this study offers fresh insights into how postcolonial sovereignty intersected with, and disrupted, global biopolitical projects. It demonstrates that population management was a multi-scalar project grounded not only in racialized Cold War biology and economy, but also in the ethical and normative considerations underpinning practices of postcolonial state-making. Building on histories of decolonization in South Asia, Cold War science and technology, and Islamic thought this dissertation then analyzes how the encounters between postcolonial sovereignty and global biopolitics unfolded in everyday Pakistan.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aHistory. 4aSouth Asian studies. 4aScience history.  aAuthoritarianism  aCold war  aFamily planning  aGender  aIslamic modernism  aSocial sciences  a0578  a0638  a058520aPrinceton University.bHistory.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864374303945nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001900131245009900150260005800249300001100307500007800318500002800396502004800424506005900472520246600531590002302997650002803020650002603048653004103074653002403115653003203139653003403171653002003205690000903225690000903234710005103243773005103294790000903345791001003354792000903364793001203373856015003385AAI2864382320220920004322.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106567  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28643823  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aZhang, Hongce.14aThe Hardware-Software Interface for Systems-on-Chip: Formal Modeling and Modular Verification. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a193 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Malik, Sharad.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aModern computing platforms are getting increasingly heterogeneous with domain-specific hardware accelerators. The heterogeneity provides efficiency in computation, however, it also brings about new challenges in specification and verification.Previously, for general-purpose processors, the instruction set architecture (ISA) created a separation between the hardware and software in terms of design and verification. It decoupled the development of a software program from the hardware implementation of the processor. Verification of hardware and software could be conducted separately with ISA as a specification for the hardware, or an abstraction of the hardware for the software. However, for specialized hardware accelerators in emerging systems-on-chip (SoCs), there is no such ISA-like model for the interface. Existing abstract models built in languages like SystemC do not specifically target the hardware-software interface, and therefore, are hard to use to separate the design and verification concerns between hardware and software.This thesis considers the instruction-level abstraction (ILA) as a generalization of the ISA to include domain-specific accelerators in heterogeneous SoCs. It first provides a formal definition of ILA, which, like the ISA, models architectural state variables and their updates in terms of instructions. It then discusses an ILA-based hardware formal verification methodology where ILA is used as a specification, and it demonstrates how formal verification can benefit from the attributes of the ILA through verification case studies. The thesis then discusses the importance of invariants in such formal hardware verification and proposes two techniques, both based on syntax-guided synthesis, forenvironment-invariant synthesis and hardware model checking, respectively. As a hardware-software interface model, ILA is also used as a hardware abstraction in  system-level hardware-software verification. Specifically, as SoC components typically use shared memory accesses for bulk data transfer, the verification must take memory consistency issues into account. This is addressed by the ILA-MCM verification framework in this thesis.In summary, this thesis presents the ILA as the hardware-software interface model for the specification and verification of modern heterogeneous SoCs. The ILA-based verification methodology allows modular verification which increases the scalability of formal SoC verification.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aElectrical engineering. 4aComputer engineering.  aDomain-specific hardware accelerator  aFormal verification  aHardware-software interface  aInstruction-level abstraction  aSystems-on-chip  a0544  a046420aPrinceton University.bElectrical Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864382303664nam a2200457   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002100131245006700152260005800219300001100277500007800288500003000366502004800396506006900444506005900513520215100572590002302723650002802746650002102774650002802795653000902823653001402832653000902846653001102855653001202866653001102878690000902889690000902898690000902907710004902916773005102965790000903016791001003025792000903035793001203044856015003056AAI2864415020220920004322.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107106  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28644150  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aChen, Edith Xin.10aSouthern Iranian Vassal States Under the Ilkhanate: 1220-1300. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a343 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Cook, Michael A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aWhile the Mongol conquests have typically been studied as a subject in military history, the local dimension – what it was like living under Mongol rule – has not received as much scholarly attention up until now. This dissertation explores how the Mongol conquest of the Middle East unfolded from the perspective of the local dynasties located in central and southern Iran. This region included Fars, Kirman, and Yazd and was not conquered by force but rather submitted voluntarily to Mongol rule. The mountainous terrain and hot climate of these parts made them less suited for nomadic armies to traverse. As a result, the Mongol rulers of Iran, the Ilkhanids, retained these vassal dynasties and administered this region indirectly through them. In exchange for contributing taxes, tribute, and sometimes troops for war, these regions enjoyed a semi-autonomous status during the early decades. For the most part, these local dynasties maintained cordial and occasionally close associations with their Mongol overlords through diplomacy, marriages, and mentorship. Patron-client ties formed between the Mongol aristocracy and these local dynasties, and the quality of these ties can bring strategic benefits to local rulers. These local dynasties also had to remit taxes to the Mongol divan. While the tax burden squeezed the local treasury, it was relatively low compared to other parts under Mongol direct rule. Until 1280, the local courts managed to have surplus revenues left after the taxes to patronize culture, scholarship, and architecture. Understanding this might explain the contradiction that despite the high taxes under Mongol rule, the local courts in Iran were able to encourage cultural flourishing and sustain Islamic scholarship during this vacuum. By the late 13th century, many of the most prosperous local dynasties in Fars, Kirman, and Yazd went into decline and came under direct rule. Without these local rulers, the local Persian elites who once had served them were recruited directly into Mongol service and continued to administer these parts. Despite the surface changes, local rule in southern Iran prevails.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMiddle Eastern history. 4aIslamic studies. 4aMiddle Eastern studies.  aFars  aIlkhanate  aIran  aKirman  aMongols  aPersia  a0333  a0512  a055520aPrinceton University.bNear Eastern Studies.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864415003995nam a2200469   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001700131245011700148260005800265300001100323500007800334500002700412502004800439506005900487520241200546590002302958650001302981650002502994650001303019650002203032653002403054653001603078653002503094653002103119653002103140653002403161690000903185690000903194690000903203690000903212710006303221773005103284790000903335791001003344792000903354793001203363856015003375AAI2864423020220920004323.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106987  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28644230  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aCho, Samuel.10aBeyond Optimization and Dynamic Programming: Incorporating Frequency-Dependent Effects Through Mean-Field Games. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a182 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Levin, Simon.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aOptimization approaches have been widely used to study the behavior of organisms. According to this idea, behaviors that lead to a selective advantage in the given environment would proliferate; thus, over time, the optimal behavior would be adopted with the phenotypic gambit assumption. Among optimization approaches, dynamic programming models, in particular, solve for a series of behavioral decisions dependent on the state of the organism, which maximizes its reproductive fitness over a time period. However, organisms exist within populations and interact directly or indirectly with others, sometimes competing or else benefiting from collective behavior. Therefore, a behavioral strategy that is optimal with respect to a fixed environment may no longer provide an advantage if every organism employs the strategy. The resulting frequency-dependent effects call for a game-theoretic approach. In this thesis, I extend the previous class of models based on optimization and dynamic programming to include the frequency-dependent effects through mean-field game models and apply this perspective to a variety of problems. The five chapters in this thesis are mostly self-contained, but Chapter 3-5 follow the theme of extending dynamic programming models, introduced in Chapter 2, to include frequency-dependence. Chapter 2 studies the population and phenological change of migratory birds by means of a dynamic programming model. Chapter 3 then investigates two approaches of including frequency-dependence into the dynamic programming framework by revisiting two previous models. Chapter 4 studies the optimal foraging problem where avoidance of predation is the main driver of choosing a foraging rate. The optimization problem is solved using the calculus of variations;  when frequency-dependence is included in the form of competition and collective vigilance, the resulting mean-field game is solved with a numerical method. Chapter 5 applies the mean-field game model to human behavior, in particular, the dilemma of social distancing during an infectious disease epidemic. Finally, the last chapter is unrelated to the overarching theme of the thesis but stems from my internship at the University of Oslo. Here, we formulate a compartmental model of bubonic plague, taking into account recent experimental results in the flea, rat, and human dynamics, as well as the effect of seasonality.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aEcology. 4aApplied mathematics. 4aBiology. 4aComputer science.  aDynamic programming  aGame theory  aMathematical biology  aMean-field games  aOptimal foraging  aTheoretical ecology  a0329  a0364  a0984  a030620aPrinceton University.bQuantitative Computational Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864423002747nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001600131245007800147260005800225300001100283500007800294500003500372502004800407506006900455506005900524520131400583590002301897650003001920650001401950653002201964653001301986653003201999653001002031690000902041690000902050710003702059773005102096790000902147791001002156792000902166793001202175856015002187AAI2864467320220920004323.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486342  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28644673  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aFort, Nyle.10aAmazing Grief: African American Mourning and Contemporary Black Activism. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a307 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Glaude, Eddie S., Jr.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aFrom slave rebellions to the fight for civil rights to recent protests against police violence, how black communities in the United States have struggled to remember, honor, and avenge the dead has profoundly influenced black political life. Amazing Grief: African American Mourning and Contemporary Black Activism demonstrates the complex and contested ways acts of public grief have shaped, and been shaped by, black activism, with particular focus on Black Lives Matter (BLM). By examining eulogies, street memorials, the activism of bereaved mothers, and invocations of the dead within electoral politics, this project shows how BLM embodies a radical politics of grief that stands within a long tradition of African American mourning. The first chapter challenges the ideologies of Afropessimism and black liberalism, both of which articulate stories of loss that stifle the more transformative dimensions of black politics. The last three chapters examine the Charleston Massacre, Michael Brown’s street memorial, and the Mothers of the Movement during the 2016 presidential election. Taken together, the dissertation charts a geography of grief—from the church to the street to the ballot—that situates African American mourning within an expansive terrain of contemporary black freedom struggle.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aAfrican American studies. 4aReligion.  aAfrican Americans  aMourning  aContemporary Black activism  aGrief  a0296  a031820aPrinceton University.bReligion.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864467303709nam a2200361   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002900131245009000160260005800250300001100308500007800319500003000397502004800427506005900475520239100534590002302925650002602948653003402974653002203008653002203030690000903052710004503061773005103106790000903157791001003166792000903176793001203185856015003197AAI2864474120220920004323.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486328  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28644741  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aNagendra, Nayana Prasad.10aImproving Instruction Cache Performance for Modern Processors with Growing Workloads. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a121 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: August, David I.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aCloud computing is the backbone of today’s digital world. Billions of devices ranging from internet-of-things to mobile phones connect to services running on massive data centers, dubbed as Warehouse Scale Computers (WSCs). Due to the scale at which WSCs operate, their performance has a huge cost impact. Even the slightest percentage improvement in performance generates significant profits for the companies that operate them. Besides, they have a hugely adverse effect on the environment because of their massive carbon footprint.Surprisingly, our work with Google shows significant inefficiencies among the WSC processor utilization. More than two-thirds of the CPU cycles are wasted in many forms. Specifically, nearly 20% of the wasted cycles come from the processor front-end, which is responsible for keeping the pipeline fed with useful instructions. Since a substantial fraction of the front-end cycle wastages occurs due to instruction cache misses, this Dissertation has taken a full-stack approach to study and solve those. There have been vast growths in data center workloads and their complexity. Consequently, programs’ working set sizes are much larger than those of the instruction caches in modern processors. With the nearing end of Moore’s Law, innovations are necessary to increase the efficiency of instruction cache usage, given the growing workloads.In this Dissertation, we first present AsmDB, a fleet-wide study of Google workloads to understand processor front-end bottlenecks. Based on our knowledge, this is the first work to study the in-depth behavior of instruction caches at such a large scale. Among its many findings, AsmDB highlights inefficient usage of instruction caches because of significant fragmentation even among the highly-optimized code.The second part of this Dissertation describes Emissary, a new approach to alleviate the said problem by using the available cache capacity more efficiently. Observing that not all cache misses cause stalls, Emissary employs a novel cache replacement algorithm that reserves cache capacity for lines whose misses cause the most significant performance impact. Emissary outperforms all known cache replacement algorithms in performance and energy consumption. In some cases, it produces speedups that exceed Belady’s OPT, the perfect-knowledge minimal miss ideal cache replacement algorithm.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aComputer engineering.  aInstruction cache performance  aModern processors  aGrowing workloads  a046420aPrinceton University.bComputer Science.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864474103556nam a2200481   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002200131245009500153260005800248300001100306500007800317500003100395502004800426506006900474506005900543520196800602590002302570650001902593650001302612650001902625650001402644653001702658653002302675653001002698653002302708653001002731690000902741690000902750690000902759690000902768690000902777710004702786773005102833790000902884791001002893792000902903793001202912856015002924AAI2864498920220920004323.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107113  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28644989  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aCooper, Claire E.10aDutch Formulations and Family Secrets: Medicine and the Marketplace in Early Modern Japan. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a305 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Marcon, Federico.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation explores Japanese commercial, intellectual, and material engagement with medicines imported by the United East India Company (VOC) and its successors from the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries. Medicinal substances sourced from across India, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East like cinnamon, cloves, and saffron constituted a major part of Dutch trade to Japan from the seventeenth century onward. Various disruptions and reorganizations of the Dutch trading network at the turn of the nineteenth century caused an increase in the supply of these goods to Japan. This coincided with renewed scholarly efforts to translate and adapt “Dutch medicine” (ranpo) for use by Japanese physicians, apothecaries, and consumers. Interest in and consumption of “Dutch medicine” peaked in the nineteenth century, and it was available across Japan as commercial medicine (baiyaku) sold in shops and by itinerant merchants. Drawing from a wide range of visual, material, and textual sources in Japanese, Dutch, and literary Chinese, this study contributes to a better understanding of the objects, mechanisms, and agents involved in early modern global trade. The Dutch trade in medicinal substances was representative of the inherently hybrid and intra-Asian nature of the goods and ideas brought to Japan by the VOC and its successors. The adaptation and consumption of these products engaged a diverse group of historical actors beyond the socio-political elite, most notably apothecaries and merchants who leveraged growing interest in “Dutch medicine” to sell their wares. As a whole, this dissertation dismantles the teleological and Eurocentric narratives of rangaku and “Dutch influence” that have informed so many histories of early modern and modern Japan, instead offering an understanding of medicine and medical knowledge that is shaped by global circulations, local practices, and the diversity of the early modern marketplace.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aAsian history. 4aHistory. 4aAsian studies. 4aMedicine.  aApothecaries  aCommercial history  aDutch  aEarly modern Japan  aTrade  a0332  a0578  a0342  a0564  a050920aPrinceton University.bEast Asian Studies.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864498904445nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001900131245010900150260005800259300001100317500007800328500002800406502004800434506005900482520298300541590002303524650002903547650002603576650002203602653002303624653002503647653002303672653001503695690000903710690000903719690000903728710004503737773005103782790000903833791001003842792000903852793001203861856015003873AAI2864504320220920004324.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106918  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28645043  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aBeatson, Alex.10aLearned Surrogates and Stochastic Gradients for Accelerating Numerical Modeling, Simulation, and Design. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a122 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Adams, Ryan P.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aNumerical methods, such as discretization-based methods for solving ODEs and PDEs, allow us to model and design complex devices, structures, and systems. However, this is often very costly in terms of both computation and the time of the expert who must specify the physical governing equations, the discretization, the solver, and all other aspects of the numerical model. This thesis presents work using deep learning and stochastic gradient estimation to speed up numerical modeling procedures.In the first chapter we provide a broad introduction to numerical modeling, discuss the motivation for using machine learning (and other approximate methods) to speed it up, and discuss a few of the many methods which have been developed to do so.In chapter 2 we present composable energy surrogates, in which neural surrogates are trained to model a potential energy in sub-components or sub-domains of a PDE, and then composed together to solve a larger system by minimizing the sum of potentials across components. This allows surrogate modeling without requiring the full system to be solved with an expensive ground-truth finite element solver to generate training data. Instead, training data are generated cheaply by performing finite element analysis with individual components. We show that these surrogates can accelerate simulation of parametric meta-materials and produce accurate macroscopic behavior when composed.In chapter 3 we discuss randomized telescoping gradient estimators, which provide unbiased gradient estimators for objectives which are the limit of a sequence of increasingly accurate, increasingly costly approximations -- as we often encounter in numerical modeling. These estimators represent the limit as a telescoping sum and sample linear combinations of terms to provide cheap unbiased estimates. We discuss conditions which permit finite variance and computation, optimality of certain estimators within this class, and application to problems in numerical modeling and machine learning.In chapter 4 we discuss meta-learned implicit PDE solvers, which allow a new API for surrogate modeling. These models condition on a functional representation of a PDE and its domain by directly taking as input the PDE constraint and a method which returns samples in the domain and on the boundary. This avoids having to fix a parametric representation for PDEs within the class for which we wish to fit a surrogate, and allows fitting surrogate models for PDEs with arbitrarily varying geometry and governing equations.In aggregate, the work in this thesis aims to take machine learning in numerical modeling beyond simple regression-based surrogate modeling, and instead tailor machine learning methods to exploit and dovetail with the computational and physical structure of numerical models. This allows methods which are more computationally and data-efficient, and which have less-restrictive APIs, which might better empower scientists and engineers.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aArtificial intelligence. 4aComputer engineering. 4aComputer science.  aLearned surrogates  aStochastic gradients  aNumerical modeling  aSimulation  a0800  a0984  a046420aPrinceton University.bComputer Science.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864504303816nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100003000131245007200161260005800233300001100291500007800302500003100380502004800411506006900459506005900528520239300587590002302980650001503003653001903018653002103037653002203058653002503080653002503105690000903130710003803139773005103177790000903228791001003237792000903247793001203256856015003268AAI2864527320220920004324.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486908  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28645273  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMartinez Alvarado, Jesus.14aThe Activation of Strong Chemical Bonds Using Photoredox Catalysis. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a265 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Doyle, Abigail G.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aDue to their stability, strong chemical bonds are ubiquitous in organic molecules. Consequently, the ability to activate these bonds provides a direct avenue for derivatizing and streamlining synthesis. Radical and/or odd-electron transition-metal intermediates are often leveraged to promote the activation of such strong chemical bonds. Recently, photoredox catalysis has served as a power method for shuttling electrons and holes to promote the production of carbon centered radicals. This work describes our approach to the activation of inert C(sp3)–H bonds of alkanes and the C–OH bonds of carboxylic acids. While C(sp3)–H bond derivatizations have proven effective for installing heteroatoms, only a handful of strategies have enabled the one-step formation of C(sp3)–C bonds. Moreover, of those methods, only a limited number are capable of aliphatic bond activation using stoichiometric quantities of substrate which may be difficult to access in large quantities in late-stage synthesis. Our approach to this problem leverages the photocatalytic generation of chlorine radical from a proposed Ni(III)–Cl intermediate. This chlorine radical then serves as a potent hydrogen atom acceptor for functionalizing alkanes. Key to the generation of chlorine radical is the pairing of a nickel catalyst with an Ir-based photoredox catalyst to regulate the oxidation states of nickel. This platform was used with acyl chloride derivatives to synthesis ketone containing products. Like C(sp3)–H bonds, carboxylic acids are an abundant and difficult to activate functional group in synthesis. The generation of acyl radicals from carboxylic acids has been accomplished using multiple derivatization steps involving the reduction of acids to aldehydes or the incorporation of redox mediators. Although enabling, these multistep reactions hinder the redox economy of accessing acyl radicals directly. In this challenge, our group leveraged photoredox catalysis to access electrophilic phosphine radical cations to generate phosphoranyl radicals through nucleophilic capture using carboxylic acids. Owing to the strong thermodynamic driving force to generate phosphine oxide, these species are capable of liberating acyl radicals through a fragmentation event known as β-scission. These acyl radicals were then used for the hydroacylation of olefins to generate aliphatic ketones.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aChemistry.  aC-H activation  aChlorine fadical  aOrganic chemistry  aPhosphoranyl radical  aPhotoredox catalysis  a048520aPrinceton University.bChemistry.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864527302983nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001300131245006200144260005800206300001100264500007800275500004400353502004800397506005900445520159500504590002302099650002802122650002602150650002002176653001602196653002102212653002102233690000902254690000902263690000902272710005102281773005102332790000902383791001002392792000902402793001202411856015002423AAI2864558220220920004324.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471111523  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28645582  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aWu, Can.10aLarge-Area Electronics for Wireless-Sensing Applications. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a232 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Sturm, James C.;Verma, Naveen.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aFuture intelligent sensing systems envision seamless integration of a large number of physical objects and sensors, which can be wirelessly addressed with high spatial specificity to enable context-awareness for perception tasks. In order to do so, the systems require monolithic, flexible, and large-area form factors. While mainstream technologies like Si-CMOS are limited by chip size and rigid substrate, large-area electronics (LAE) has the potential to meet these requirements thanks to low-temperature processing. However, due to the low performance of the LAE devices, i.e., thin-film transistors (TFTs), thus far, the highest operation frequency achieved in LAE is only about 10 MHz, far below the system requirements in the gigahertz range.In this work, we address this challenge by device, circuit, and system co-designs. First, at the device level, gigahertz cut-off frequencies for zinc-oxide (ZnO) TFTs, acting as both active and passive devices, are demonstrated. They bring LAE into the radio frequency (RF) domain and open an unprecedented design space for realizing high spatial resolutions in wireless systems. Next, we develop oscillator circuits and resonant RF switches. Using them as building blocks, we design and build three wireless systems operating at gigahertz frequencies: (1) a phased antenna array, which enables fine beam control; (2) a reconfigurable antenna with dynamically tunable operating frequency and directionality; and (3) a fully passive backscatterer with zero static power consumption, enabling blind beamforming in the incident beam direction.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aElectrical engineering. 4aComputer engineering. 4aRemote sensing.  aElectronics  aWireless sensing  aPerception tasks  a0544  a0464  a079920aPrinceton University.bElectrical Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864558203319nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001500131245009500146260005800241300001100299500007800310500003300388502004800421506005900469520194400528590002302472650002402495650002902519653002502548653002202573653002002595653000902615690000902624690000902633710003802642773005102680790000902731791001002740792000902750793001202759856015002771AAI2864581820220920004324.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486434  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28645818  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aKim, Hwon.10aStudies of Photophysics Overarching the Spin Manifolds Using Correlated Quantum Chemistry. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a168 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Scholes, Gregory D.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe thesis shows various applications of quantum chemistry in uncovering the photophysics of processes involving transitions between different spin manifolds. From the simple intersystem crossing between two spin manifolds enabled by relativistic effects to electronically coupled transitions such as singlet fission and triplet-triplet annihilation, the crossover of different spin manifolds of molecular excited states offers numerous applications in catalysis and optoelectronic devices. The experiments have accumulated rich history of suggesting new solutions to energetically efficient execution of chemical reactions and harvesting of light energy. However, the experiments often do not suffice to shed light on the mechanism behind the phenomena that will give insights to reinforce the further development of the field. The questions that were addressed with the quantum chemical methods include the mechanism of efficient intersystem crossing of organic photocatalyst, the spectroscopic features encountered during singlet fission, and the effect of substituents on oscillator strength of molecules with inverted energy levels of singlet and triplet excited states. The physical insights obtained from the calculations show that the electronic configurations that mix into the dominant configuration through electronic correlation play cardinal roles in explaining the experimental results or suggesting a new strategy of molecular design. The reorganization of catalyst upon photoexcitation changes the originally single configuration nature of electronic states to highly mixed configuration that enables rapid intersystem crossing, the charge transfer states between monomers in singlet fission system bring new features to the excited state absorption spectrum, and geometries modified by steric hindrance leads to orbital overlaps that satisfies both inverted singlet triplet energy and appreciable transition dipole moment.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPhysical chemistry. 4aComputational chemistry.  aIntersystem crossing  aQuantum chemistry  aSinglet fission  aTADF  a0494  a021920aPrinceton University.bChemistry.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864581803485nam a2200457   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002700131245008100158260005800239300001100297500007800308500003200386502004800418506006900466506005900535520194200594590002302536650001802559650001402577650002302591650002702614653001602641653000902657653001902666653001902685690000902704690000902713690000902722690000902731710004602740773005102786790000902837791001002846792000902856793001202865856015002877AAI2864587520220920004325.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106796  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28645875  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aEickhoff, Michaela Jo.10aRegulation of Vibrio Quorum Sensing in Natural and Competitive Environments. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a152 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Bassler, Bonnie L.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aBacteria have the remarkable ability to rapidly and accurately detect and adapt to fluctuations in the environment. Often, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms function in concert to tune gene expression patterns that enhance survival and conserve resources under varying conditions. Among the changes bacteria monitor and respond to is the cell density and species composition of the vicinal community. Bacteria accomplish this using quorum sensing (QS), a cell-cell communication process that alters global gene expression patterns to foster the synchronous execution of collective behaviors. QS involves the production, release, accumulation, and group-wide detection of signaling molecules called autoinducers (AIs). The marine bacterium V. harveyi produces and responds to three AIs, which act in parallel. At low cell-density, AI concentrations are low, and a phosphorelay cascade leads to the activation of five small regulatory RNAs called Qrr1-5 that post-transcriptionally regulate target genes, leading to a downstream QS regulon of over 600 genes. Because Qrr1-5 largely function redundantly, the advantages of encoding five qrr genes are not well-understood. This work explores the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms controlling the QS regulon and how the V. harveyi QS response is altered in the presence of competing bacterial species. First, a new QS regulator called LuxT is discovered to repress the transcription of one Qrr small RNA, Qrr1. As a repressor of qrr1, LuxT indirectly regulates Qrr1 target mRNAs, demonstrating how Qrr1 can control gene expression independently of Qrr2-5. Second, LuxT is also identified as a global regulator that functions in parallel to QS to control over 400 genes. Finally, a co-culture model between V. harveyi and its competitor Vibrio fischeri is established to study QS interactions in competitive multi-species environments.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMicrobiology. 4aGenetics. 4aMolecular biology. 4aDevelopmental biology.  aCompetition  aLuxT  aQuorum sensing  aVibrio harveyi  a0410  a0369  a0307  a075820aPrinceton University.bMolecular Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864587502948nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002500131245002500156260005800181300001100239500007800250500002800328502004800356506005900404520164800463590002302111650001602134650002202150653001202172653001402184653001702198653001602215690000902231690000902240690000902249710003902258773005102297790000902348791001002357792000902367793001202376856015002388AAI2864606020220920004325.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471106710  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28646060  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aCheek, Nathan Norem.14aThe Thick Skin Bias. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a212 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Shafir, Eldar.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aI propose a novel explanation for many of the social class disparities documented across the social and behavioral sciences: the “thick skin bias.” Across 33 studies, I show that people of lower socioeconomic status (SES) are systematically perceived to be less harmed by negative events than higher-SES people, even when this is patently false. In Chapter 1, I provide initial demonstrations of this thick skin bias, rule out multiple alternative explanations, and show that the bias extends to judgments about children as young as five and to judgments made by several professional populations and a nationally representative sample of the U.S. In Chapter 2, I investigate one mechanism underlying the thick skin bias: an overgeneralization of the sometimes accurate intuition that perceptions adapt to prior levels of exposure (as in psychophysical adaptation). Chapter 3 extends the thick skin bias to the context of gender-based violence, and Chapter 4 extends it to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Chapter 4 also tests the efficacy of providing people with an informational prime as a method of reducing the thick skin bias: information reduces, but does not fully reverse, the perception that people in poverty are less harmed by negative events. A brief conclusion charts future directions for research on the causes and consequences of and potential cures for the thick skin bias. Taken together, the work in this dissertation offers a new direction for research on social class stereotypes and provides a new perspective on how biased beliefs about people in poverty justify, perpetuate, and exacerbate economic inequality.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPsychology. 4aSocial structure.  aPoverty  aPrejudice  aSocial class  aStereotypes  a0621  a0501  a070020aPrinceton University.bPsychology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864606003707nam a2200433   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002000131245003500151260005800186300001100244500007800255500004800333502004800381506006900429506005900498520227400557590002302831650001602854650002302870653001402893653002302907653001002930653001302940653001102953653001102964690000902975690000902984710003902993773005103032790000903083791001003092792000903102793001203111856015003123AAI2864629920220920004325.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486984  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28646299  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aYau, Claudia M.10aWisdom in Plato and Aristotle. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a168 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Lorenz, Hendrik;Morison, Benjamin.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation investigates the accounts of wisdom (sophia) developed by Plato and Aristotle in the Republic, Nicomachean Ethics, and Metaphysics. In endorsing particular conceptions of wisdom, Plato and Aristotle were engaging in a long-standing dispute, spanning the archaic and classical periods, over the title. ‘Sophia’ conferred significant power and prestige, so there were real stakes in the outcome of the contest. Wisdom also does significant explanatory work in their ethics, politics, and epistemology: it is the highest virtue of the rational soul and is required for the best human life and a flourishing political community. Despite wisdom’s importance, there has not been much systematic treatment of it for either philosopher.Plato and Aristotle are standardly thought to agree that wisdom is the ability to understand certain abstract, metaphysically basic entities: Plato thinks wisdom is knowledge of the Forms and Aristotle thinks wisdom is understanding about divine beings. The central aim of this dissertation is to show that they in fact endorse diametrically opposed conceptions of wisdom. According to Plato, wisdom makes use of and requires knowledge of Forms, but its purpose is to make good judgments about the perceptible realm. Aristotle, by contrast, explicitly denies that wisdom is aimed at action; wisdom proper deals with the abstract, fundamental metaphysical truths of reality.This dissertation contains four chapters. Chapter 1 argues that wisdom is not identical to knowledge of the Forms. Chapter 2 defends the following definition: wisdom is the ability to make good judgments, referencing the Forms as a standard, about the city or soul as a whole. Chapter 3 shows that in the NE, Aristotle offers a rigorous, though compressed, argument for his conception of wisdom as episteme and nous of the most honorable things. The argument relies on a commitment to a hierarchy of intellectual states and the identification of sophia as the state which ranks highest. Chapter 4 turns to the Metaphysics, where Aristotle appears to present two competing characterizations of wisdom. I argue that that these conceptions describe a single, unified state, and that this is the very state Aristotle identifies as wisdom in the NE.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPhilosophy. 4aClassical studies.  aAristotle  aNicomachean ethics  aPlato  aRepublic  aSophia  aWisdom  a0422  a043420aPrinceton University.bPhilosophy.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864629903198nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001400131245008200145260005800227300001100285500007800296500003000374502004800404506005900452520172600511590002302237650002802260650002102288653002502309653003202334653002002366653002002386653002702406653001902433690000902452690000902461710006502470773005102535790000902586791001002595792000902605793001202614856015002626AAI2864637520220920004325.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486717  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28646375  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aXue, Nan.10aGravity-Induced Flows: Buoyancy-Driven Flows and Interfacial Thin-Film Flows. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a203 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Stone, Howard A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aGravity is a ubiquitous force that induces a series of flows. In this Dissertation, I will discuss two aspects of gravity-induced flows using theory and experiments: the buoyancy-driven flows in miscible liquids and the gravitational draining liquid thin-film flows in air. I will first show a pattern formation system induced by the buoyancy-driven flow: the layering in a latte. Distinct patterns form after pouring hot espresso into a glass of warm milk. By experimentally identifying critical conditions to produce the layering, the mechanics of the layering is related to double-diffusive convection, which is commonly discussed in oceanography. The mixing dynamics during the pouring are further modeled and studied. I will then show how to control the layered structure by pouring and then employing this single-step process to produce soft, layered materials. I will then focus on the gravitational draining film on a vertical plate. I will first show the Marangoni rising flow on a draining film when the draining film contacts a liquid bath with surfactant. The thickness profile of the draining film determines the dynamics of the rising flow. Next, I will show a self-similar film structure, inspired by the observation of a draining film near a vertical edge. The nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE), which describes the film profile with three independent variables, can be converted to an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Finally, together with the structure of the draining film, I will show the gravitational spreading of a liquid on a funnel and a bowl. The geometries on where the liquid converges cause different spreading dynamics and induce new thresholds for fingering instabilities.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMechanical engineering. 4aFluid mechanics.  aBuoyancy-driven flow  aDouble-diffusive convection  aGravity current  aSelf-similarity  aSurface tension effect  aThin-film flow  a0548  a020420aPrinceton University.bMechanical and Aerospace Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864637503709nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002900131245006900160260005800229300001100287500007800298500003000376502004800406506005900454520236400513590002302877650002002900650001302920653001102933653001102944653000802955653001302963690000902976690000902985710007602994773005103070790000903121791001003130792000903140793001203149856015003161AAI2864637820220920004326.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486649  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28646378  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aNelson, Andrew Oakleigh.10aComprehensive Dynamic Analysis of the H-Mode Pedestal in DIII-D. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a248 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Kolemen, Egemen.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe H-mode pedestal, characterized by steep gradients and reduced transport, is an essential feature of tokamak plasmas that couples the cold Scrape-Off-Layer (SOL) to the hot, fusion-relevant core. Though existing magnetohydrodynamic models yield some insight into the pedestal, they are (due to the complexity of interaction between the pedestal and the rest of the plasma) unable to fully predict pedestal behavior from generalized plasma conditions. To progress towards a more comprehensive understanding of pedestal dynamics, a larger context must be considered. Using state-of-the-art modeling and perturbative experimental techniques on DIII-D, this thesis develops a broader empirical understanding of dynamic pedestal behavior that will inform future modeling efforts.The pedestal obeys the physics of the continuity equation, which is set by the sourcing of particles, inter-ELM transport, and boundary conditions.  In this light, three phenomena are selected for in-depth study: fueling, transport, and SOL interactions.  First, the effect of particle sources on the pedestal structure is examined through a series of dedicated experiments on DIII-D.  Gas and pellet fueling techniques are applied to change the neutral ionization profile at similar plasma conditions, showing that the structure of the pedestal can vary significantly with changes to the neutral source profile.  Second, a novel experimental technique is used to probe the nature of inter-ELM turbulence, which is linked to the evolution and recovery of the pedestal structure. Additional current is induced in the pedestal region of several DIII-D plasmas, providing a first-of-its-kind experimental demonstration of microtearing modes (MTMs) in the tokamak edge. MTMs may contribute strongly to intense heat fluxes through the pedestal region, potentially providing the groundwork for an entirely physics-based predictive model of pedestal behavior. Finally, to develop a physics understanding of how the SOL boundary condition couples with the pedestal over the course of an entire plasma discharge, detailed modeling work is performed with the UEDGE code as a function of pedestal and ELM conditions. In this section, we establish a dynamic connection between the pedestal structure and divertor behavior, highlighting the need for a comprehensive approach to pedestal physics.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPlasma physics. 4aPhysics.  aFusion  aH-mode  aMTM  aPedestal  a0759  a060520aPrinceton University.bAstrophysical Sciences—Plasma Physics Program.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864637803994nam a2200469   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002500131245012200156260005800278300001100336500007800347500004600425500004700471502004800518506005900566520232200625590002302947650001602970650001802986650002803004650002403032653003003056653003603086653002103122653002103143653001803164690000903182690000903191690000903200690000903209710006503218773005103283790000903334791001003343792000903353793001203362856015003374AAI2864646820220920004326.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107212  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28646468  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aHeinrich, Matthew A.10aMacroscopic Tissue Growth, Expansion, and Collision: Biophysical Insights toward Tissue Sheet Engineering Strategies. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a135 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aIncludes supplementary digital materials.  aAdvisor: Cohen, Daniel J.;Kosmrlj, Andrej.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aAs an organism develops and maintains homeostasis, many thousands of cells must act in concert within and between tissues. How these collective cellular behaviors are coordinated has been a question of interest for over a century, with importance to developmental, regenerative, and pathological processes.In the last decade, in vitro studies of tissues have brought breakthroughs showing how forces, stresses, traveling waves, and other physical processes provide a basis for biological processes within a tissue like cell migration and proliferation. However, these studies most commonly involve much smaller length scales and shorter time scales than the physiological processes they represent. Additionally, biophysical studies of epithelial tissues rarely examine the interactions between tissues that occur when these systems come into contact. Together, we lack knowledge on how epithelial tissues coordinate biophysical processes across larger length scales, over longer timescales, and during higher-level interactions.We address this first by studying millimeter-scale tissue expansion at high resolution over several days. We find that the tissue edge starkly decouples from the tissue bulk, producing size and memory effects in patterns of cell migration and proliferation. We also find the first example of millimeter-scale coordinated vortices in unconfined cohesive tissue and explore this process with an active polar fluid model. We finally investigate how cell migration, cell density, and cell proliferation all evolve concomitantly.We then probe higher-level tissue-tissue interactions by studying the collisions between expanding tissues. We find that these tissues change shape as they collide, which we predict according to the dynamics of single tissue expansion. We then find that genetically identical tissues displace one another due to cell density gradients at their collision boundaries and use the dynamics of this process to extract mechanical properties from the colliding tissues. Finally, we harness the dynamics of tissue expansion and collision to design arrays that self-assemble into centimeter-scale tessellations.Overall, we find that macroscale epithelial tissues support large and long-lasting coordinated behaviors, which we harness to engineer tissue as a living material.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aBiophysics. 4aBiomechanics. 4aBiomedical engineering. 4aSystematic biology.  aCollective Cell Migration  aMadin-Darby Canine Kidney cells  aTissue collision  aTissue expansion  aTissue growth  a0786  a0648  a0541  a042320aPrinceton University.bMechanical and Aerospace Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864646803009nam a2200373   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002000131245007900151260005800230300001100288500007800299500003100377502004800408506005900456520168900515590002302204650002102227650002602248653001602274653002102290690000902311690000902320710006502329773005102394790000902445791001002454792000902464793001202473856015002485AAI2864648620220920004326.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486557  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28646486  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aHuang, Yi-Chun.10aExperimental Methods for Understanding Turbulence in the Lower Atmosphere. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a144 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Hultmark, Marcus.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aStudy of the atmospheric boundary layer is of critical importance since a myriad of processes in this region are intrinsically linked to atmospheric transport and mixing, from dispersion of aerosol particles or pollen plumes, to modeling of weather and climate, and even to predator-prey tracking. On the larger scale, accurately representing land-atmospheric exchange processes remains a challenge in numerical weather predictions due to heterogeneities in topography, land cover, and stability. To address some of the difficulties encountered in probing the atmospheric surface layer, a unique and economically scalable field measurement platform was designed using nano-scale sensors and deployed in Utah's West Desert. Streamwise velocity and temperature data in the first meter above ground were captured with unprecedented spatial resolution, which allowed for an examination of their clustering properties under various atmospheric stability regimes. On a smaller scale, the atmospheric flow environment also dictates the mate- and/or host-seeking behavior of numerous animals. For one, female mosquitoes locate potential hosts by tracking carbon dioxide, volatile skin emanations, humidity, and thermal cues, each of which acts as a passive scalar distributed by local flow conditions. Thus, a better understanding of how the female mosquito responds to cues under various flow settings will facilitate strategies that seek to disrupt its host-seeking behavior and curtail the spread of mosquito-borne diseases. To this end, a low-cost active grid with individually controlled winglets was designed and constructed to mimic features of atmospheric flow in laboratory settings.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aFluid mechanics. 4aAtmospheric sciences.  aTurbulence   aLower atmosphere  a0204  a072520aPrinceton University.bMechanical and Aerospace Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864648602735nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002300131245008500154260005800239300001100297500007800308500002900386502004800415506005900463520129100522590002301813650001501836650002301851650002601874653002701900653002201927653003201949653002601981690000902007690000902016690000902025710003802034773005102072790000902123791001002132792000902142793001202151856015002163AAI2864657920220920004326.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107489  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28646579  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aNguyen, Loi Thanh.10aFrustrated Magnetism in Hexagonal Perovskites as Quantum Spin Liquid Candidates. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a349 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Cava, Robert J.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aHexagonal oxide perovskites, in contrast to the more familiar perovskites, allow for face-sharing of metal-oxygen octahedra or trigonal prisms within their structural frameworks. This results in dimers, trimers, tetramers, or longer fragments of chains of face-sharing octahedra in the crystal structures, and consequently in much shorter metal-metal distances and lower metal-oxygen-metal bond angles than are seen in the more familiar perovskites. The presence of the face-sharing octahedra can have a dramatic impact on magnetic properties of these compounds, and dimer-based materials, for example, have been the subjects of many quantum-materials-directed studies in materials physics. Hexagonal oxide perovskites are also of contemporary interest due to their potential for geometrical frustration of the ordering of magnetic moments or orbital occupancies at low temperatures, which is especially relevant to their significance as quantum materials. As such, several hexagonal oxide perovskites have been identified as potential candidates for hosting the quantum spin liquid state at low temperatures. Therefore, hexagonal oxide perovskites are fertile ground for finding new quantum materials. This thesis briefly describes the solid state chemistry of many of these materials.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aChemistry. 4aMaterials science. 4aAnalytical chemistry.  aFace-sharing octahedra  aQuantum materials  aHexagonal oxide perovskites  aSolid state chemistry  a0485  a0486  a079420aPrinceton University.bChemistry.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864657902447nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001900131245010500150260005800255300001100313500007800324500003000402502004800432506005900480520104400539590002301583650002501606650001101631653002101642653001501663653002001678653002201698653002401720690000901744690000901753710003401762773005101796790000901847791001001856792000901866793001201875856015001887AAI2864662820220920004327.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486922  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28646628  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aHerron, Molly.10aComposing with Musical Instruments: Physicality and Instrument Intervention in the Creative Process. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a208 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Trueman, Daniel.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aFor many composers, the physical practice of making music with an instrument plays a prominent role in their creative process. While intellectual and abstract forms of musical understanding have received much attention in scholarship, the body’s knowledge and understanding of music—and its place in the creative process—is often overlooked. Composers with and without instrumental expertise incorporate the influence of instrumental understanding in their compositions. This can be through direct experience or abstract understanding and it affects music in both concrete and ephemeral ways. Instrumental knowledge can also hinder the creative process in a variety of ways for different artists. Through interviews and the analysis of composed works, the work and personal experiences of fifteen composers, including the author, form the central offering of this paper. Interspersed with first hand accounts are voices from scholars of musicology, music cognition, philosophy of perception, and music technology and instrumentality.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMusical composition. 4aMusic.  aCreative process  aEmbodiment  aMusic cognition  aMusic composition  aMusical Instruments  a0214  a041320aPrinceton University.bMusic.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864662803315nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002200131245011800153260005800271300001100329500007800340500004300418502004800461506005900509520189900568590002302467650001202490650002302502650001602525653002402541653001802565653001502583690000902598690000902607690000902616710003902625773005102664790000902715791001002724792000902734793001202743856015002755AAI2864717120220920004327.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107748  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28647171  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aZhang, Erik Yuan.10aMaking the Numbers Count Without Counting the Numbers: A Nonconsequentialist Account of Interpersonal Trade-Offs. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a104 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Frick, Johann;Smith, Michael.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation develops and defends a nonconsequentialist account of interpersonal trade-offs. The account finds application in situations in which different individuals have interests in being aided that cannot be jointly satisfied.Chapter One articulates a theoretical foundation for reasoning about interpersonal trade-offs. The framework I defend is an individualist one: In adjudicating between the competing interests of different individuals, our decision should be justifiable to each of those affected. I show that individualist moral theories, most notably Scanlonian contractualism, can be sensitive to the significance of numbers without resorting to the familiar consequentialist idea of maximizing aggregate well-being. In short, nonconsequentialists can make the numbers count without directly counting the numbers.Chapter Two further develops one key result arrived at by the end of Chapter One, namely, individualist moral reasoning, suitably understood, supports a general approach to interpersonal trade-offs commonly known as Limited Aggregation. I propose a novel development of Limited Aggregation, which I call the Partial Primacy Account (PPA). I show that PPA is not only theoretically well-motivated, it is also capable of convincingly handling the purported counterexamples to Limited Aggregation that have been advanced in the recent literature.Finally, in Chapter Three, I examine an issue that arises in the context of adjudicating between competing individual interests under conditions of risk and uncertainty. Here, I wade into the ongoing debate between the ex ante and the ex post approaches to risk, and I offer a qualified defense of the ex post framework. My defense is qualified in that it allows for the relevance of ex ante reasoning in a range of trade-off situations. My discussion can be thus understood as advocating for a hybrid account of risk.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aEthics. 4aSocial psychology. 4aPhilosophy.  aNonconsequentialist  aInterpersonal  aTrade-offs  a0394  a0451  a042220aPrinceton University.bPhilosophy.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864717103602nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002800131245005800159260005800217300001100275500007800286500004600364500002700410502004800437506006900485506005900554520218000613590002302793650002302816650001802839653001602857653002602873690000902899690000902908710004602917773005102963790000903014791001003023792000903033793001203042856015003054AAI2864732720220920004327.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486885  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28647327  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMoore, Gabriel Maurice.10aElucidating the Pathogenic Repertoire of a Bacterium. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a113 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aIncludes supplementary digital materials.  aAdvisor: Gitai, Zemer.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aNosocomial infections, or those associated with clinical settings, present a major health and financial problem for healthcare infrastructure. In order to successfully prevent or treat these infections, we have to effectively identify pathogens as they arise and characterize the factors required for them to carry out their pathogenicity. While many higher priority pathogens have been able to be studied due to conventional detection methods, environmentally-derived or “rare” pathogens are often overlooked that may provide greater insight into shared mechanisms of virulence. Caulobacter, an aqueous- and soil-associated genus, has historically been thought to be non-pathogenic despite several clinical reports of Caulobacter-associated infections. Understanding the mechanism by which Caulobacter can persist in hospital settings and thrive within a human host to cause disease is critical, as this bacterium has been proposed as a tool both for environmental bioremediation and a clinical therapeutic.This work brings to light the potential pathogenicity of Caulobacter and seeks to holistically understand aspects of Caulobacter physiology facilitate pathogenesis or virulence. First, I use comparative genomics to describe a novel species of Caulobacter isolated from a patient. Furthermore, I use the in vivo infection model Galleria mellonella to describe a mechanism for virulence used by both clinical and environmental isolates in this model. Next, in order to holistically characterize Caulobacter in genetic screens, I created the first ordered transposon library in Caulobacter crescentus, the most widely studied species of the Caulobacters. This ordered library was used to screen for novel components that contribute to Caulobacter pathogenicity. Lastly, using the ordered library, I was able to both validate known aspects of Caulobacter physiology as well as identify novel determinants related to cell growth, surface attachment, motility, biofilm formation, and cell shape. Taken together, this work redefines our classical thinking of Caulobacter as “nonpathogen” while generating a tool for the community to better understand this bacterium.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMolecular biology. 4aMicrobiology.  aCaulobacter  aPathogenic repertoire  a0307  a041020aPrinceton University.bMolecular Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864732703762nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001800131245007800149260005800227300001100285500007800296500004200374502004800416506005900464520243500523590002302958653001002981653001302991653002703004653001803031690000903049690000903058690000903067690000903076710003803085773005103123790000903174791001003183792000903193793001203202856015003214AAI2864738620220920004327.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107373  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28647386  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aQuach, Simon.10aEssays in Overtime Regulation, Wage Rigidity, and Unemployment Insurance. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a261 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Lee, David S.;Farber, Henry.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aMy dissertation empirically investigates the ways that employers and workers respond to government interventions in the labor market. Using these behavioral responses, I test theories in labor economics and estimate key parameters for welfare decisions.Chapter 1 evaluates the impact of overtime coverage on the US labor market. Leveraging high-frequency administrative payroll data, I analyze recent expansions in overtime protection for low-income salaried employees and find evidence inconsistent with two prominent views of the labor market. In contrast to the work-sharing theory of overtime, expansions in coverage led to a net loss, rather than an increase, in employment. Moreover, contrary to the compensating differentials model, firms did not reduce workers’ base salaries to offset the increased labor costs, but instead raised them so that employees are no longer eligible for overtime. Taken together, the estimates of these responses imply a large negative elasticity of employment with respect to wages. Chapter 2 tests for wage rigidity by studying employers' response to the unexpected suspension of a reform that would have granted overtime coverage to salaried employees earning less than $913 per week. Although the policy was nullified, I find that employers nevertheless raised incumbents’ base pay right above the overtime eligibility threshold and this bunching persisted even two years after the policy was terminated. Consistent with downward nominal wage rigidity, employers also did not compress workers’ future wage growth to offset the initial pay increase and continued paying new hires’ salaries at the threshold. Chapter 3, co-authored with David S. Lee, Pauline Leung, Christopher J. O'Leary, and Zhuan Pei, examines the fiscal cost of increasing unemployment insurance benefits. To aid analytical tractability, researchers typically require a simplified model of behavior to estimate the deadweight loss associated with reforms to income transfer programs. In comparison, we employ a complementary "decomposition'' approach that compares the behavioral and mechanical components of a policy's total impact on the government budget to study the deadweight loss of two unemployment insurance policies. Experimental and quasi-experimental estimates using state administrative data show that increasing the weekly benefit is more efficient than reducing the program's implicit earnings tax.  aSchool code: 0181.  aLabor  aOvertime  aUnemployment Insurance  aWage Rigidity  a0510  a0501  a0629  a051120aPrinceton University.bEconomics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864738602748nam a2200469   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002100131245007300152260005800225300001100283500007800294500003200372502004800404506006900452506005900521520118700580590002301767650001401790650001701804650003001821650002601851653002601877653001601903653001601919653001301935653001401948690000901962690000901971690000901980690000901989710003901998773005102037790000902088791001002097792000902107793001202116856015002128AAI2864761220220920004328.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107717  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28647612  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aFloyd, Samantha.10aWhen One Meaning Is Not Enough: Word Learning in a Polysemous World. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a158 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Goldberg, Adele E.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aWords commonly refer to multiple meanings, a phenomenon known as polysemy: caps can appear on bottles, human heads, or mushrooms; green can refer to a color or an environmental stance; a sheet can be in a notebook or on a bed. Polysemy presents a challenge to many theories of meaning and learning, which posit individual meanings and competition between candidate referents. As a result, many open questions remain about how polysemous meanings are learned and represented. In this dissertation, I address these fundamental issues from a number of angles, using behavioral, developmental, clinical, and computational methods. I first review existing approaches to word meaning and representation (Chapter 2). I then investigate how children and adults uncover and learn the rich, hidden conceptual structure of meanings using novel learning tasks (Chapter 3) and eye- tracking (Chapter 4). In Chapter 5 I investigate variation in generalization by considering a neurodiverse population. In Chapter 6, I develop and evaluate theories of word generalization in quantifiably-testable computational models. Finally, in Chapter 7 I outline a new approach to understanding word learning.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aLanguage. 4aLinguistics. 4aDevelopmental psychology. 4aCognitive psychology.  aCognitive linguistics  aComputation  aDevelopment  aLearning  aSemantics  a0679  a0620  a0290  a063320aPrinceton University.bPsychology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864761204058nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100003500131245008900166260005800255300001100313500007800324500004900402502004800451506006900499506005900568520249000627590002303117650001903140650002203159650002303181653001903204653002103223653002303244653002403267653001703291690000903308690000903317690000903326710003603335773005103371790000903422791001003431792000903441793001203450856015003462AAI2864776620220920004328.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486724  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28647766  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aHarvey, Caitlin Patricia Alma.10aBricks and Mortar Boards: University-Building in the Settlement Empire, 1840–1920. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a425 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Cannadine, David N;Colley, Linda J.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation examines the tremendous expansion of university education across Britain’s colonies of settlement and their self-governing successors—Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States—from new universities’ shaky beginnings at the start of the nineteenth century to their firm foundations and continued growth a century later. Imperial, national, state or provincial legislation such as the American Morrill Act created over one hundred new institutions of higher education within eighty years. The imperative to build universities for settlers did not come from Britain. Nor were these institutions, as some scholars have suggested, the clear derivatives of European universities. In addition, before 1900, most settlers regarded undergraduate education as a “questionable experiment” due to the elitism of higher education, but also because access to elementary and secondary schooling was far from commonplace. The question at the core of this dissertation, then, is: why were so many universities built at all?In order to explain universities’ spread and staying power, Bricks and Mortar Boards covers the financial and administrative records of thirty-six universities on four continents, studied together for the first time. It argues that universities’ expansion depended on a confluence of contingent factors and at least one necessary condition: capital. A combination of religious rivalry, political fragmentation, interinstitutional and intercolonial learning, and distinctive financing strategies—based upon Indigenous land endowments and mineral wealth—propelled the incredible expansion of public universities across the nineteenth-century settler world.﻿Bricks and Mortar Boards also serves as a wider case study of how non-governmental institutions perpetuated the authority of settler-colonial states and became a part of a broader move to territorialize Indigenous land. Britain’s global empire facilitated connections between settler institutions—of students, professors, technologies, and ideas—meaning that these universities did not develop in isolation from one another. Looking across these universities thus reveals patterns in their development that are not discernable at the level of a single institution. Instead, in a period of global migrations, gold rushes, and state expansion, educationalists who were oceans apart faced similar challenges and drew on imperial networks to overcome them.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aWorld history. 4aHigher education. 4aEducation history.  aBritish Empire  aImperial history  aIndigenous studies  aSettler colonialism  aUniversities  a0506  a0745  a052020aPrinceton University.bHistory.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864776604101nam a2200469   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100003000131245009200161260005800253300001100311500007800322500003000400502004800430506005900478520250400537590002303041650002803064650002203092650002203114650002403136653001903160653002003179653001803199653003203217653002103249653001903270690000903289690000903298690000903307690000903316710006503325773005103390790000903441791001003450792000903460793001203469856015003481AAI2864786020220920004328.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107632  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28647860  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLaChance, Julienne Marie.10aMachine Learning and Statistical Analysis of the Collective Behaviors of Large Tissues. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a166 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Cohen, Daniel J.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aCoordinated cellular motion is crucial for proper tissue organization and function. The ability to efficiently analyze group behaviors within large epithelial tissues (>50,000 cells) offers the exciting potential for new discoveries in morphogenesis, growth, wound healing, and possibly even cancer invasion. In recent years, a number of techniques, particularly in the deep learning space, have emerged as promising tools for managing the complexity of large populations of cells. My research focuses on the problem of discovering collective phenomena to better understand and control large epithelial tissues, with an emphasis on deep-learning-driven methods for automated analysis. There are multiple challenges that I have addressed towards this end. First, methods for gathering data pertaining to the physical and dynamical properties of cells (location, size, shape) must be both efficient and minimally disruptive to cell behavior. I have developed an algorithm to perform automatic reconstruction of sub-cellular features directly from transmitted light microscopy images, thereby mitigating the need for expensive, time-consuming, and phototoxic fluorescence images, while enabling rapid post-processing of massive datasets. Second, patterns of cell proliferation and migration must be analyzed in expanding tissues of larger sizes (at the millimeter-scale) and over longer times to capture crucial dynamics. I present data comprising the first comprehensive study of macro-scale, long-term epithelial expansion. Third, automated methods for the discovery of collective phenomena in large tissues must realistically capture biological complexity. I apply deep attention networks to epithelial cell trajectory data in order to gain insight into collective rules, with recommendations towards future research directions. In addition to my collective dynamics work, I led a team of engineers in response to the CoVID-19 pandemic, designing a low-cost, pressure-controlled ventilator. The open-source design has already proven a viable research platform for machine learning control strategies, enabling safer and more robust mechanical ventilation for all patients. By designing a new set of methods for the exploration of large tissue dynamics, I aim to inspire new strategies for manipulating mechanisms within a living tissue; to streamline scientific research in both academia and industry; and to motivate novel control policies in systems involving non-biological, decentralized swarms.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMechanical engineering. 4aCellular biology. 4aComputer science. 4aSystematic biology.  aCell migration  aComputer vision  aDeep learning  aFluorescence reconstruction  aMachine learning  aSwarm dynamics  a0548  a0379  a0984  a042320aPrinceton University.bMechanical and Aerospace Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864786003068nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002200131245005300153260005800206300001100264500007800275500003100353502004800384506005900432520166700491590002302158650002302181650002802204653003502232653001402267653001402281653002002295653001302315653002002328690000902348690000902357710003902366773005102405790000902456791001002465792000902475793001202484856015002496AAI2864798420220920004329.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486373  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28647984  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aStarck, Jordan G.10aPerpetuating Inequality in Pursuit of Diversity. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a121 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Sinclair, Stacey.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation investigates the role of instrumental diversity rationales in perpetuating racial inequality. Instrumental rationales are pervasive in education (Starck, Sinclair & Shelton, 2021), legal (Frymer & Skrentny, 2004), and organizational contexts (Georgeac & Rattan, 2020).  Previous work has shown that they are also associated with greater disparities in the graduation rates of universities’ White and minority students (Starck et al., 2021).  The current work seeks to uncover mechanisms through which instrumental rationales may cause racially disparate outcomes. In the first part of the dissertation, I evaluate whether instrumental rationales correspond with lower uptake of teaching practices intended to assist racial minority students.  The first study therein evaluates this hypothesis by asking a sample of teachers about their expectations regarding culturally responsive teaching at instrumentally and morally motivated schools, and the second study replicates the first while providing additional insights into the mechanisms driving our anticipated effect. In the second part of the dissertation, I evaluate whether instrumental diversity rationales create environments that subject racial minorities to greater social pain. The first study in this section tests this hypothesis in a classroom context while the second study tests it in a social environment characterized by intergroup conflict. These studies inform legal and organizational discourse about whether and why to value diversity through investigating how the dominant approach to diversity in the U.S. might facilitate racial inequality in educational organizations.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aSocial psychology. 4aEducational psychology.  aCulturally responsive teaching  aDiversity  aEducation  aInstrumentality  aMorality  aObjectification  a0451  a052520aPrinceton University.bPsychology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864798403659nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002400131245006000155260005800215300001100273500007800284500003300362502004800395506005900443520219300502590002302695650002302718650002702741650001602768653001802784653001802802653001802820653002002838653002302858653001802881690000902899690000902908690000902917710004602926773005102972790000903023791001003032792000903042793001203051856015003063AAI2864807920220920004329.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486441  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28648079  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aJena, Siddhartha G.10aSignaling Dynamics Shape Gene Regulation across Scales. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a171 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Toettcher, Jared E.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe comparison of cells to computing machines is cliched, perhaps, but at least somewhat accurate. Cells are under profound pressure to interpret information from their surroundings and current internal state, and to turn this information into actions that they must perform to stay alive. Continuing with our analogy, signaling pathways are the wires of the massive computer contained in each and every cell. Although there are a large number of signaling pathways, the realm of behaviors that any one pathway can control is enormous. Time-varying inputs, or signaling dynamics, provide a possible explanation for how one pathway may convey different types of information to a range of targets. Rather than simply be on or off in a time-invariant fashion, a pathway can exhibit pulses of rapid activation and inactivation, the frequency, duration, and amplitude of which may be all interpreted in different ways by various cellular machinery. However, if and how signaling dynamics can transmit information to cellular behavior remains largely unexplored. Here, I explore gene regulation downstream of signaling dynamics, with a primary focus on using the Ras/Erk signaling pathway as a testbed. This pathway has been studied for decades, yet only recently has been found to exhibit rapid, pulsatile dynamics in a range of systems. Elucidating the function of dynamics and how they feed forward into gene regulatory mechanisms requires the use of interdisciplinary approaches that study effects from the molecular to the population level. I first study the emergence of transcriptional heterogeneity as a function of signaling duration, amplitude, and combinatorics. Next, I use chromatin profiling to better understand how regulatory DNA responds to optogenetic pulses of signaling input. Moving to the level of population-level signaling dynamics, I leverage machine learning methods to elucidate the autonomous and coupled contributions to cell signaling, using cellular perturbations from a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) drug screen. Lastly, I discuss the effects that can arise when transcription factor dynamics intersect with regulatory logic in chromatin in a developing animal.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMolecular biology. 4aDevelopmental biology. 4aStatistics.  aErk signaling  aHeterogeneity  aKeratinocytes  aPoint processes  aSignaling dynamics  aTranscription  a0307  a0758  a046320aPrinceton University.bMolecular Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864807905008nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001600131245015600147260005800303300001100361500007800372500004900450502004800499506005900547520339000606590002303996650001504019650002304034650002504057650002604082653002804108653002604136653004004162653004504202690000904247690000904256690000904265690000904274710003804283773005104321790000904372791001004381792000904391793001204400856015004412AAI2864827420220920004329.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107809  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28648274  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aNi, Danrui.10aHigh-Pressure Synthesis of Solid State Inorganic Lead-Containing Compounds and Quaternary Chalcopyrite Semiconductors with Improved Hydrogen Evolution. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a146 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Cava, Robert J.;Bocarsly, Andrew B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aInorganic semiconducting materials synthesized by solid-state methods have been a focus of interest recently in multiple areas including condensed matter physics, optoelectronic and photovoltaic studies, and heterogeneous catalysis. In this thesis, we have synthesized several inorganic semiconducting metal chalcogenides/chalcogenide halides using solid state preparation methods, and investigated their structural, physical, optical and/or photocatalytic properties. A high-pressure method was adopted to prepare new phases that have not been previously reported in ambient pressure syntheses: 1) PbS2 was prepared at 4 GPa and 600 °C and was determined to crystallize in the CuAl2 structure type, (I4/mcm (#140), a = 6.1106(5) A, c = 7.4949(6) A, Z = 4). Its structure consists of layers of [S2]2- dimers and Pb2+ in square antiprismatic coordination - a rare structure type for metal dichalcogenides. Electronic structure calculations suggest that the material should be an indirect band gap semiconductor. The transport properties and magnetic behavior of the compound was investigated, and the Seebeck coefficient was measured on an Ag-doped sample; it is small and shows nearly linear temperature-dependent behavior from 50 to 250 K. 2) Pb4S3I2, a high-pressure phase in the PbS-PbI2 system, was prepared by the reaction of a stoichiometric ratio of Pb, S and PbI2 at 4 GPa and 600 °C. Its crystal structure, determined from single crystal X-ray diffraction, is orthorhombic (space group Pnma) with a = 8.1293(6) A, b = 15.5613(11) A, c = 8.1820(6) A, and Z = 4 at ambient temperature and pressure. The structure consists of sheets of distorted edge-sharing lead-centered polyhedra and saw-tooth-shaped lead-lead bonded chains. The material is predicted by theoretical calculations to be an indirect-band semiconductor, and the band gap is measured experimentally to be around 1.6 eV. 3) Pb3Se2Br2 was synthesized at 4 GPa and 700 °C. Its crystal structure is determined to be body centered cubic and non-centrosymmetric (Th3P4 structure type, space group I4̅3d, #220) with a = 9.3200(4) A at room temperature and ambient pressure. The Pb atoms are coordinated by eight anions in a dodecahedron, with Se and Br occupying the same crystallographic site in a disordered 1:1 ratio. Pb3Se2Br2 is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 1.48 eV, determined by diffuse reflectance measurements. The indirect band gap is theoretically supported by density functional theory calculations.In a second branch of the chemical investigation of semiconductors, quaternary AgxCu1-xGayIn1-yS2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1.0) chalcopyrite semiconductors (SCIGS) were prepared using a solid state method at ambient pressure in a search for improved photocathode materials for fuel-producing photoelectrochemical cells. The quaternary system enables enhanced control of the materials’ electronic and electrochemical properties compared to the ternary system, and allows for adjustment of the band structures and photocatalytic abilities to a finer degree than is possible in the traditional ternaries. The prepared semiconductors were tested for photochemical hydrogen evolution, and several of the quaternary AgxCu1-xGayIn1-yS2 compositions were found to show better water reduction capability than the ternaries, even when a platinum co-catalyst is present in the ternary systems.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aChemistry. 4aMaterials science. 4aInorganic chemistry. 4aChemical engineering.  aHigh pressure synthesis  aSolid state chemistry  aInorganic semiconducting materials   aMetal chalcogenides/chalcogenide halides  a0485  a0794  a0488  a054220aPrinceton University.bChemistry.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864827403922nam a2200457   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001500131245009700146260005800243300001100301500007800312500003400390502004800424506005900472520234100531590002302872650001402895650002002909650001902929653002502948653003102973653000903004653001903013653002503032653003603057653004003093690000903133690000903142690000903151710006303160773005103223790000903274791001003283792000903293793001203302856015003314AAI2864842920220920004329.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107823  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28648429  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aJo, Brian.10aAnalysis of Distal eQTLs across Multiple Human Tissues and Methods to Improve Their Quality. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a150 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Engelhardt, Barbara.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aAs we experience exponential growth in available sequencing data for humans, a detailed understanding of the genetic basis of variation in gene expression is being achieved. One of the ways we are observing this is through genome-wide association mapping of distal expression quantitative loci (distal eQTLs). Unlike cis-eQTLs, distal eQTLs face numerous challenges, including weak signal and large number of hypotheses (contributing to low power), as well as numerous and often cryptic sources of confounding. However, despite all of these challenges, an extensive repository of human distal eQTLs can prove highly valuable; when used in conjunction with cis-eQTLs, GWAS of complex traits, gene networks and more recently, single cell datasets, a highly detailed picture of gene regulation can be achieved.This work first presents the most extensive mapping of human distal eQTLs to date, and explore approaches to improve their quality. Using the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) dataset with 838 donors with samples across 49 human tissues, I present a repository of over 5000 distal eQTLs across multiple tissues. This work was one of the major contributions to the GTEx consortium publications, which contributes to the field of human genomics with an extensive public repository of genotype, expression, and other phenotypes, along with summary statistics. This work also focuses on exploring the relationship among the cis-eGene, trans-eGene and sample heterogeneity, or cell type information when available. We show that in many reported distal eQTLs, sample heterogeneity can play a regulatory role, while in other cases, a relationship between cis-eGene and trans-eGene can be narrowed down to specific cell types. Finally, I take a statistical approach and analyze the landscape of association statistics, especially in the context of covariance structures among variants, genes and tissues. I find that if we take these covariance structures into account properly, the significance testing procedure can yield results that depart significantly from results obtained using common methods, which treat all tissues, genes and variants identically. All of these results contribute to human genetics research by identifying potential issues with the ever increasing collection of human distal eQTLs, and how we can address them.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aGenetics. 4aBioinformatics. 4aBiostatistics.  aFalse discovery rate  aGenotype-Tissue Expression  aGWAS  aHuman genetics  aStatistical genetics  aGenome-wide association

In this thesis, I present how methods from physics can help us in understanding the mechanical properties of these systems as well as gaining further intuition. First, we develop a multipole expansion method to describe the deformation of infinite as well as finite solid structures with cylindrical holes and inclusions by borrowing concepts from electrostatics, such as induction and method of image charges. Our method shows excellent agreement with finite element simulations and experiments. Next, using representation theory, I show how symmetries of phononic crystals affect the degeneracies in their phononic band structures. Deformation of phononic crystals under external load that causes breaking of some symmetries can lead to the lifting of degeneracies for bands and creating gaps such that waves of certain frequencies become disallowed. Finally, using methods from statistical physics, I present how the mechanical properties of atomically thin 2D sheets and shells get modified due to thermal fluctuations. Freely suspended sheets subject to such fluctuations are much harder to bend, but easier to stretch, compress and shear, beyond a characteristic thermal length scale, which is on the order of nanometers for graphene at room temperatures. Just like in critical phenomena, these renormalized elastic constants become scale dependent with universal power-law exponents. In nanotubes, competition between stretching and bending costs associated with radial fluctuations introduces another characteristic elastic length scale, which is proportional to the geometric mean of the radius and effective thickness. Beyond this elastic length scale, bending rigidities and in-plane elastic constants of nanotubes become anisotropic.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aApplied physics. 4aStatistical physics. 4aMechanical engineering.  aElasticity  aSoft condensed matter  aStatistical mechanics  aTopological mechanics  a0215  a0217  a054820aPrinceton University.bElectrical Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864914904040nam a2200433   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002700131245008400158260005800242300001100300500007800311500005000389502004800439506006900487506005900556520248500615590002303100650001303123650002603136653002203162653001903184653003603203653002203239653001203261653001303273690000903286690000903295710006103304773005103365790000903416791001003425792000903435793001203444856015003456AAI2864943820220920004330.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486816  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28649438  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aHutchinson, Matthew C.10aForaging in a Variable World: Species Interactions across Ecological Gradients. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a207 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Pringle, Robert M.;Dobson, Andrew P.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation explores one broad question; how consistent are dietary niches? Between species? Under resource limitation? In different ecological contexts? In each chapter, this question is asked of a different aspect of trophic ecology and at a different biological scale. A broad and deep literature documents population-level diets; can synthesizing this literature identify generalities in diet composition? Seasonality defines most ecosystems; do resource-availability fluctuations alter guild-level niche organization? Trophic webs are typically studied with a taxonomically or functionally narrow lens; does a broader scope alter our understanding of network structure and its implications? Chapter 1 is a global synthesis of population-level vertebrate diets that asks whether defining those diets as abundance distributions reveals general patterns in their composition. After compiling a dataset of almost 1200 population-level diets from more than 500 species, I found that dietary-abundance distributions (DADs) were overwhelming (92.5%) best described by a hollow curve function implying that few dietary items are eaten commonly and many are eaten occasionally. Moreover, flatter DADs representing more generalized diets were associated with sampling across seasons, observational sampling methods, herbivory, and omnivory.Chapter 2 explores how seasonality in a Mozambican savanna modulates dietary niche overlap among large mammalian herbivores. Using almost 2000 dung samples from 13 large herbivore species in three seasons across four years, I found that population-level diet breadth was greater in the dry season. However, dietary niche overlap between species decreased concurrently (following Pianka's niche overlap hypothesis). This pair of results suggests that Rosenzweig and Abramsky's theory of centrifugal niche organization, developed to explain habitat use, may structure herbivore dietary niche organization.   Chapter 3 documents a clear link, in a Kenyan savanna, between the presence of large mammalian herbivores and the structure of plant-pollinator networks. When large herbivores were excluded from 1-ha vegetation plots, flowers were threefold more abundant and 50% more diverse. As a result, pollinators were 20% more active and 50% more diverse. In combination, networks of interactions between plants and pollinators were larger, more functionally redundant, and less susceptible to pollinator loss when large herbivores were absent.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aEcology. 4aConservation biology.  aCommunity ecology  aDiet selection  aDietary-abundance distributions  aDNA metabarcoding  aSavanna  aUngulate  a0329  a040820aPrinceton University.bEcology and Evolutionary Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864943803941nam a2200457   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002900131245009800160260005800258300001100316500007800327500003600405502004800441506006900489506005900558520238200617590002302999650002303022650001303045650001903058653001703077653001103094653001003105653001903115653001803134653002603152690000903178690000903187690000903196710003703205773005103242790000903293791001003302792000903312793001203321856015003333AAI2864947520220920004330.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486571  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28649475  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aKistner, Michael Robert.10aFundraising for the Caucus: Money, Party Politics, and Policymaking in American Legislatures. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a151 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Canes-Wrone, Brandice.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aAmerican legislators devote a large and growing amount of time in office to raising money. This dissertation advances our understanding of the causes and consequences of caucus fundraising systems, the party-directed efforts that encourage such fundraising. To do so, I turn to a little explored source of evidence: state legislatures.The second chapter explains the conditions under which parties develop caucus fundraising systems. Using original data linking state legislators to leadership PACs and campaign committees, I show that competition for majority status leads legislators to contribute more to party organizations and candidates, due in large part to parties in competitive chambers selecting committee chairs based on members' contributions. However, parties only institute such systems when powers such as chair appointments are centralized. These findings reveal that parties must possess both the incentives and resources necessary to implement caucus fundraising systems.The third chapter of the dissertation begins unpacking one consequence of this accelerating money race: a diminished capacity to develop public policy. A formal model that considers how pressures shape policymaking is analyzed. The theory distinguishes between two types of policy. I find that the development of collaborative policy is negatively affected by electioneering demands as well as ideological disagreement. In contrast, these same factors lead to more individualistic policy. The theory has implications for research on legislative productivity and is used to structure the analysis of the subsequent chapter.The fourth chapter evaluates whether fundraising demands inhibit policymaking as the theory predicts. The empirics take advantage of state-level variation in campaign finance reforms that reduce the amount of fundraising legislators engage in. Using an original method of identifying important state legislation based on textual similarity to policy enactments discussed in national news, I construct a dataset of major legislation enacted in the states over a period of 20 years. Panel data models provide evidence that decreasing fundraising demands in legislatures leads to the passage of more major enactments. These findings provide a novel explanation for pervasive gridlock in the modern U.S. Congress and suggest practical ways this gridlock can be reduced.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPolitical science. 4aFinance. 4aPublic policy.  aFundraising   aCaucus  aMoney  aParty politics  aPolicymaking   aAmerican legislatures  a0615  a0630  a050820aPrinceton University.bPolitics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864947503584nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002900131245009900160260005800259300001100317500007800328500002700406502004800433506005900481520208600540590002302626650002002649650002102669650001302690653002802703653002102731653002102752653002302773653001802796653002002814690000902834690000902843690000902852710003602861773005102897790000902948791001002957792000902967793001202976856015002988AAI2864956820220920004330.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107274  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28649568  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aGuardado-Sanchez, Elmer.10aExploring Many-Body Quantum Dynamics with Rydberg Dressed Fermions and Tilted Hubbard Systems. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a205 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Bakr, Waseem.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aUltracold atomic gases in optical lattices are an ideal platform for studying quantum many-body physics. The long timescales and isolated nature of these systems makes them particularly suited for exploring the dynamics of nearly closed quantum systems and their relaxation towards thermal equilibrium. In this thesis, we demonstrate the realization of two novel cold atom systems: lattice Fermi gases with non-local interactions and tilted Fermi-Hubbard systems. In both of these systems, we explore the slow relaxation of density perturbations, either due to kinetic constraints or unusual hydrodynamics.The first system we study is a Fermi gas laser coupled to a Rydberg state. For near resonant coupling of a localized gas in a unit-filled lattice, we realize a quantum Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields. We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of antiferromagnetic correlations in this spin system. For far off-resonant Rydberg coupling, we prepare itinerant Fermi gases with strong non-local interactions. In this Rydberg-dressed regime, we introduce a small Rydberg admixture to the ground state of the system which results in a laser-tunable soft-core interaction potential. We use this technique to realize a $t-V$ model with spin-polarized fermions and study the dynamics of imprinted charge density waves. For strong off-site interactions, the number of bonds is approximately conserved, which leads to slow relaxation of these states. More generally, the Rydberg-dressing technique is promising for future studies of extended Hubbard models in multi-component systems.  The second system we study is the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model in the presence of a large tilt. When the tilt is aligned with a lattice axis, the system exhibits slow thermalization and subdiffusive charge transport due to modified hydrodynamics where heat transport acts as a bottleneck for charge transport. This work sets the stage for studying the complete breakdown of thermalization expected for more generic tilt angles where Hilbert space fragmentation is expected.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aAtomic physics. 4aQuantum physics. 4aPhysics.  aLong-range interactions  aOptical lattices  aQuantum Dynamics  aQuantum Simulation  aRydberg atoms  aUltracold gases  a0748  a0599  a060520aPrinceton University.bPhysics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864956802795nam a2200349   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001600131245004300147260005800190300001100248500007800259500004600337502004800383506005900431520158300490590002302073650001302096653002802109653002202137690000902159710003602168773005102204790000902255791001002264792000902274793001202283856015002295AAI2864980120220920004331.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486915  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28649801  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aJi, Ziming.10aNon-Archimedean and Non-local Physics. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a250 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Gubser, Steven S;Giombi, Simone.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aPhysics defined on real manifolds and equipped with locality has achieved many successes theoretically as well as in describing our universe. Nevertheless, from a mathematical point of view, it is not as privileged. This thesis explores the possibility of non-Archimedean and non-local physics by studying a range of discrete and continuous models. We begin by discussing how continuous dimensions with different topologies emerge from a sparse coupling lattice model inspired by a recent cold atom experiment proposal. A field theory with both non-Archimedean and Archimedean dimensions is then studied. The propagator of the theory possesses oscillatory behavior. We work out the renormalization and compare the theory with the quantum Dyson's hierarchical model at the criticality. We then proceed to study two non-local field theories: the non-local non-linear sigma model and the non-local quantum electrodynamics. Non-locality altered the behavior of NLSM profoundly by eliminating the Ricci flow and demanding higher-order covariant corrections in the target space. At the same time, the interplay between non-locality and gauge symmetry generates unique RG flows in the non-local QED and makes the theory more controllable. We conclude by introducing a monodromy defect defined in O(N) symmetric conformal theories, which by definition, supports a non-local CFT on the defect. Throughout the journey, we want to convey the idea that non-Archimedean physics and non-local physics exhibits rich and unique phenomena yet are not disconnected from the more ordinary physics.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPhysics.  aNon-Archimedean physics  aNon-local physics  a060520aPrinceton University.bPhysics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864980103692nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001800131245003500149260005800184300001100242500007800253500002600331502004800357506006900405506005900474520235900533590002302892650001602915650001902931653001002950653001402960653001402974690000902988690000902997710004703006773005103053790000903104791001003113792000903123793001203132856015003144AAI2864986720220920004331.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486793  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28649867  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aXiong, Wanru.10aSex Ratio Imbalances in China. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a200 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Hendi, Arun.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation examines three topics related to population sex ratio imbalances in China. Chapter I focuses on variations in sex ratios across regions, age, and time, and Chapters II and III on variations across regions and socioeconomic status. Chapter I proposes a self-corrective mechanism to describe dynamics of regional sex ratios at birth and sex ratios at prime marriageable ages. The mechanism consists of two pathways. First, internal migration redistributes men and women across regions, thus reducing highly skewed regional sex ratios at prime marriageable ages. Second, a competitive marriage market for men reduces incentives for son-biased sex selection, thus lowering sex ratios at birth. Empirical analyses using prefectural-level sex ratios in four population censuses from 1982 to 2010 are consistent with the mechanism, suggesting that regional sex ratios may be subject to homeostatic forces within the population system. Chapter II identifies educational and spatial mismatches in the marriage market. Using census samples from 2000 to 2015, I quantify individual marriage prospects in spatially and socially defined local marriage markets using availability ratios. Results show that the educational mismatch caused by the incompatibility between educational expansions and social norms of female educational hypergamy makes marrying difficult for the least-educated men and the most-educated women. Internal migration alleviates part of the spatial mismatch arising from regional differences in sex ratios at birth but generates a spatial mismatch because economic opportunities and marriage prospects are not concentrated in the same places for men. Chapter III investigates whether a shortage of marriageable women induces trafficking of women for forced marriage, which is a common narrative in public discourse. I assemble a dataset of 1,215 trafficking transactions of women for forced marriage from 2010 to 2018 using court documents. My analysis suggests that the trafficking of women is not a direct consequence of local shortages of marriageable women. The fundamental causes are instead entrenched patriarchal values as indicated by a high local sex ratio at birth, sex-specific internal migration, and the marriage squeeze endured by socially marginalized men in the context of a shortage of women in the population.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aDemography. 4aAsian studies.  aChina  aMigration  aSex ratio  a0938  a034220aPrinceton University.bPopulation Studies.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2864986703729nam a2200433   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002900131245007400160260005800234300001100292500007800303500003100381502004800412506005900460520228300519590002302802650002502825650002102850650002702871653001802898653001702916653002202933653002402955653001202979690000902991690000903000690000903009710003603018773005103054790000903105791001003114792000903124793001203133856015003145AAI2865008620220920004331.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107670  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28650086  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aPopov, Fedor Kalinovich.10aNew Developments in Vector, Matrix and Tensor Quantum Field Theories. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a199 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Klebanov, Igor R.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis thesis is devoted to studies of quantum field theories with dynamical fields in the vector, matrix or tensor representations of O(N) symmetry groups. These models provide interesting classes of exactly solvable models that can be examined in detail and give insights into the properties of other, more complicated quantum field theories.The introduction to the thesis reviews the general ideas about why such systems are interesting and exactly solvable. The different classes of Feynman diagrams which dominate the large N limits are exhibited. The introduction is partially based on work with Igor R. Klebanov and Preethi Pallegar.Chapter 2 is based on work with Igor R. Klebanov, Preethi Pallegar, Gabriel Gaitan and Kiryl Pakrouski. It is dedicated to the study of quantum Majorana fermionic models. The refined energy bound is derived for these models.  We study these models numerically, analytically and qualitavely. All of these results hint that the vector quantum mechanics undergoes second order phase transition and has a limiting temperature in the large N limit. Chapter 3 is based on papers with Igor R. Klebanov, Simone Giombi, Grigory Tarnopolsky and Shiroman Prakash. It is dedicated to the search of a stable bosonic tensor and SYK-like theories in higher dimensions. We propose two models: prismatic and supersymmetric that have a positive potential and therefore these theories should be stable unlike the bosonic tensor models with quartic tetrahedral interactions. Chapter 4 is based on papers with Igor R. Klebanov and Christian Jepsen. It studies the properties of RG flow and bifurcations that could arise in this case. We consider a theory of symmetric traceless matrices in d=3-e dimensions and analytically continue the rank of these matrices to fractional values. At some values of N we managed to find a fixed point whose stability matrix has a pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues. From the theory of ordinary differential equations it is known that it corresponds to Hopf bifurcation and that at some values of N a stable limit cycle exists, that we also find numerically. Such an approach is extended to the case of O(N) x O(M) group, where it is shown that a homoclinic RG flow exists, which starts and terminates at the same fixed point.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aTheoretical physics. 4aQuantum physics. 4aComputational physics.  aLarge N limit  aLimit Cycles  aMajorana Fermions  aQuantum Information  aRG flow  a0753  a0599  a021620aPrinceton University.bPhysics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2865008605121nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002700131245008500158260005800243300001100301500007800312500004400390502004800434506006900482506005900551520358200610590002304192650001604215650001904231650003204250653001604282653003504298653001004333653001304343653001504356690000904371690000904380690000904389710003604398773005104434790000904485791001004494792000904504793001204513856015004525AAI2865009320220920004331.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107441  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28650093  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aStarkowski, Kristen H.10aDoorstep Moments: Close Encounters with Minor Characters in the Victorian Novel. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a214 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Nunokawa, Jeff;Salamon, Gayle.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aDoorstep Moments focuses on three questions that influence our understanding of literary character and novel form. (1) Who counts as a minor character? (2) What is the role of the minor character across nineteenth-century fiction? And (3) does character position align with theories of the minor in Victorian society—women, the poor, the non-white? To address these questions, I adapt a term from Erving Goffman’s sociology—the doorstep—to describe how minor characters undermine the fictional worlds they inhabit by distracting readers from main scenes. These characters allow readers to peek into underdrawn narrative spheres and glimpse life on the fringes of society, whether due to gender, working-class status, vagrancy, or disability. By combining my training in literary studies with digital humanities approaches, I intervene in recent debates about character position by supplementing analysis of page space with network analysis: whether characters are major or minor has as much to do with their connection to other characters and objects as it does with their presence on a specific number of pages.Chapter one of Doorstep Moments distinguishes fictionality from functionality through close readings of the servants and laborers in Charles Dickens’s Our Mutual Friend: these characters are so busy working that they disregard the primary settings of the novel and gesture toward a teeming social world just out of reach. Chapter two uses archival findings from the penny periodical press to track the effect of the 1838 Amendment to the Vagrant Act on the history of characterization in working-class literature. Chapter three pinpoints how the changing economy of female caregiving labor in the Victorian period connects to the place of disabled minor characters in Charlotte Bronte’s Villette. Chapter four spotlights butlers, cooks, valets, and footmen who refuse to keep their proper place in William Makepeace Thackeray’s Vanity Fair. Looking to re-negotiate class boundaries, these minor characters leave the space of the doorstep and muddy the markers of bourgeois domestic sensibility. Together, these chapters map moments when narrators invite readers into residual textual spheres, exposing worlds that are never entirely revealed.Throughout the dissertation, I challenge the notion—offered by critics such as E.M. Forster, Alex Woloch, and Deidre Lynch—that minor characters are unfinished figures. In the process, I align considerations of a character’s minorness with social marginality—both in the 19th Century and today. Among nineteenth-century novels written in England, little has been said about the minor character as an intersectional positionality and on character space in the working-class canons, and so the stakes of the research are high. The project (1) articulates a theory of minorness: Victorian novelists used minor characters to integrate or segregate impermissible subjects in order to facilitate new political agendas, (2) combines techniques of page space and network analysis to reframe how we define a minor character, revealing that characters, whether “major” or “minor,” must be rethought in terms of relation and not frequency of appearance in the text, (3) expands the archive of relevant nineteenth-century materials to show a pre-history of fan fiction that both undermines and predates 20th- Century arguments about minor-character elaboration, and (4) demonstrates how characterological minorness aligns with nineteenth-century social debates surrounding labor, vagrancy, and disability.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aLiterature. 4aArt criticism. 4aBritish & Irish literature.  aFan fiction  aDefinition of minor characters  aLabor  aVagrancy  aDisability  a0401  a0365  a059320aPrinceton University.bEnglish.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2865009304072nam a2200493   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002200131245008000153260005800233300001100291500007800302500002900380502004800409506005900457520245200516590002302968650002502991650002203016650002803038650002603066650002903092653001303121653002303134653002103157653002303178653002003201653002003221690000903241690000903250690000903259690000903268690000903277710005103286773005103337790000903388791001003397792000903407793001203416856015003428AAI2865026020220920004332.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107229  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28650260  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aAsadi, Amir Reza.10aNeural Network Learning: A Multiscale-Entropy and Self-Similarity Approach. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a248 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Abbe, Emmanuel.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aNeural networks are machine learning models whose original design has been vaguely inspired by networks of neurons in human brains. Due to recent technological advances that have enabled fast computations on larger models and more training data, neural networks have found many applications in a growing number of areas of science such as computer vision, natural language processing, and medical imaging. Despite the practical successes of training these models with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or its variants, finding a proper theoretical ground for the learning mechanism of these models yet remains an active area of research and a central challenge in machine learning. In this dissertation, to construct a theoretical underpinning for these machine learning models, we focus on the main characteristic of neural networks that distinguishes them from other learning models, i.e., their multilevel and hierarchical architecture. Based on ideas and tools from information theory, high-dimensional probability, and statistical physics, we present a new perspective on designing the architecture of neural networks and their training procedure along with theoretical guarantees. The training procedure is multiscale in nature, takes into account the hierarchical architecture of these models, and is characteristically different from SGD and its extensions which treat the whole network as a single block and from classical layer-wise training procedures. By extending the technique of chaining of high-dimensional probability into an algorithm-dependent setting, the notion of multiscale-entropic regularization of neural networks is introduced. We show that the minimizing distribution of such regularization can be characterized precisely with a procedure analogous to the renormalization group of statistical physics. Then, motivated by the fact that the basis of renormalization group theory is the notion of self-similarity, an inherent type of self-similarity in neural networks with near-linear activation functions is identified. This kind of self-similarity is then exploited to efficiently simulate an approximation to the minimizing distribution of multiscale-entropic regularization as the training procedure. Our results can also be viewed as a multiscale extension of the celebrated Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution and the maximum entropy results of Jaynes (1957), and a Bayesian variant of the renormalization group procedure.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aInformation science. 4aComputer science. 4aElectrical engineering. 4aComputer engineering. 4aArtificial intelligence.  aChaining  aInformation Theory  aMachine Learning  aMultiscale Entropy  aNeural Networks  aSelf-Similarity  a0723  a0984  a0544  a0464  a080020aPrinceton University.bElectrical Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2865026003003nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001700131245003700148260005800185300001100243500007800254500002800332502004800360506005900408520167000467590002302137650001602160650001302176653001302189653002402202653001602226690000902242690000902251690000902260690000902269710007402278773005102352790000902403791001002412792000902422793001202431856015002443AAI2865046420220920004332.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107304  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28650464  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aXue, Lirong.10aBig Data in Financial Economics. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a252 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Fan, Jianqing.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation focuses on understanding several finance and economics problems using big data. We first process and analyze financial textual data to investigate how sentiments can be learned directly from news data. We present a novel framework for textual analysis based on the factor model and sparsity regularization, called FarmPredict, to let machines learn financial returns from news data automatically without the help of prior knowledge like sentiment dictionaries. We validate our method using the articles in the Chinese stock market and analyze the magnitude, sources, and durations of effects caused by the positive or negative sentiments scored.   Then we focus on high-frequency financial data and study the question of how and when returns are predictable at a high-frequency level. We quantify and document the predictability and its universality in very short horizons of a few seconds or transactions. We discover the inherent sources of this predictability and extrinsic cross-sectional and time-series factors and market environments affecting the predictability. We also examine how the predictability is affected by the timeliness of data.   Finally, we investigate the problem of measuring housing activity in real estate economics. Timely measuring housing activeness at high-resolutions is critical for policy-making and urban design but hard, if not impossible. By using energy consumption data to infer housing activeness and modeling several disjoint datasets including nightlight satellite images and land-use data, we build an approach that can explain the majority of the spatial and temporal variation in monthly housing usages.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aStatistics. 4aFinance.  aBig data  aFinancial economics  aFarmPredict  a0463  a0508  a0511  a050120aPrinceton University.bOperations Research and Financial Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2865046404161nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001700131245008600148260005800234300001100292500007800303500003200381502004800413506005900461520275700520590002303277650001503300653002203315653002603337653001303363653002603376653003703402653003603439690000903475710003803484773005103522790000903573791001003582792000903592793001203601856015003613AAI2865063320220920004332.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486359  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28650633  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aQiu, Guanqi.10aMechanistic Understanding of Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer and Deracemization. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a324 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Knowles, Robert R.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aWhile the synthetic aspects of Multisite proton-coupled electron transfer (MS-PCET) continue to advance, detailed mechanistic studies of MS-PCET activations remain rare. The first chapter presents a detailed kinetic study of MS-PCET activations of aryl ketones using a variety of Bronsted acids and excited-state Ir(III)-based electron donors. Both the hydrogen-bonding equilibrium constants and the rate constants for the PCET event were simultaneously extracted from deconvolution of the luminescence quenching data. These experiments confirm that these activations occur in a concerted fashion, wherein the proton and electron are transferred to the ketone substrate in a single elementary step. The slope of the rate−driving force relationship deviated significantly from expectations based on Marcus theory. A rationalization for this observation is proposed based on the principle of non-perfect synchronization, wherein factors that serve to stabilize the product are only partially realized at the transition state. The second chapter presents the first study sought to elucidate the factors that control chemoselectivity in MS-PCET reactions. We present a kinetic study that provides a quantitative basis for understanding the chemoselectivity in competitive PCET activations of amides and thiols relevant to catalytic olefin hydroamidation reactions. These results demonstrate how the interplay between PCET rate constants, hydrogen-bonding equilibria, and rate-driving force relationships jointly determine PCET chemoselectivity under a given set of conditions. In turn, these findings predict reactivity trends in a model hydroamidation reaction, rationalize the selective activation of amide N−H bonds in the presence of much weaker thiol S−H bonds, and deliver strategies to improve the efficiencies of PCET reactions employing thiol cocatalysts. In the last chapter, a general strategy for assessing C–H homolysis mechanisms is presented. The deracemization of C–H containing stereocenters can be achieved via several C–H activation mechanisms. Knowing the activation mode is crucial for expanding the scope of deracemization. However, determining which of these mechanisms is operative can be challenging as the starting material and the product of a deracemization reaction are indistinguishable. Therefore, we opted to use deuteration as a mechanistic probe. Our method involves determining the isotope fractionation of deuterium between solvent and substrate that provides a readout for the operative mechanism due to isotope effects. The H/D exchange mechanism determined by this fractionation slope method and that predicted by the known properties of substrate, intermediate, and catalysts, are in excellent agreement.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aChemistry.  aIntrinsic barrier  aIsotope fractionation  aKinetics  aPCET chemoselectivity  aProton-coupled electron transfer  aRate-driving force relationship  a048520aPrinceton University.bChemistry.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2865063303709nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002000131245004600151260005800197300001100255500007800266500003400344502004800378506005900426520237500485590002302860650001802883650002102901650001502922653001602937653001802953653002402971690000902995690000903004690000903013710003603022773005103058790000903109791001003118792000903128793001203137856015003149AAI2865071020220920004332.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107830  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28650710  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aRoulet, Javier.14aThe Binary Black Holes of LIGO and Virgo. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a172 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Zaldarriaga, Matias.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aOver the last six years, the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors have revolutionized gravitational wave astronomy by discovering the first compact binary mergers. There is much to learn about how these systems form in nature, and these discoveries have allowed to start characterizing the astrophysical population of binary black holes. Many layers of data processing are needed in the path from raw gravitational wave data to inference of astrophysical implications. In this thesis, I worked on algorithms to search for signals from compact binary mergers, estimating their parameters and analyzing them collectively to infer properties of the astrophysical population, aimed at key questions in gravitational wave astronomy: What is the rate of binary mergers in the Universe? What is the distribution of masses and spins? What is the formation mechanism of merging binary black holes?I construct a bank of waveform templates suitable for searching compact binary mergers in gravitational wave data through matched-filtering. The resulting bank is defined on a geometric space, whose notion of distance between waveforms naturally corresponds to their response mismatch. Beyond aiding intuition, this feature enables optimal placement of templates, dynamical refinement of the search, and powerful and robust signal quality tests. Using this template bank, my collaborators and I carried out a search for binary black holes in public LIGO-Virgo data, confirming previous detections and identifying nine new events.I compute the likelihood function for the parameters of the individual sources, such as black hole masses and spins. I derive a framework to combine these pieces of information into a likelihood for the collective distribution of these parameters, that accounts for measurement uncertainties, selection effects and statistical significance of the events. With this, I test and constrain phenomenological models for the distribution of binary black hole masses, spins, merger rates and cosmological evolution. I find that the mass distribution features a steep drop around 40 solar masses, as predicted by the pair-instability supernova mechanism; but also features an extended tail to higher masses. The distribution of spin orientations is anisotropic, disfavoring dynamical formation channels as the only pathway for merging binary black holes.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aAstrophysics. 4aNuclear physics. 4aAstronomy.  aBlack holes  aData analysis  aGravitational waves  a0596  a0756  a060620aPrinceton University.bPhysics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2865071002021nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002200131245004000153260005800193300001100251500007800262500004200340502004800382506005900430520069900489590002301188650001201211650001601223650001101239653001401250653002201264653001801286690000901304690000901313690000901322710003901331773005101370790000901421791001001430792000901440793001201449856015001461AAI2865074720220920004332.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107540  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28650747  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aAyars, Alisabeth.14aThe Publicity of Practical Reasons. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a119 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Rosen, Gideon;Frick, Johann.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation consists of three papers relating to the theme of the shared nature of practical reasons.

But covert action is not monolithic—it includes psychological, political, economic, and paramilitary activity—and current theories do not explain under what conditions each covert option is chosen. Congress regulates the CIA’s capacity to conduct covert action as part of its oversight of national security agencies. I categorize laws passed by Congress to regulate covert action along two dimensions: authority (prohibitive or enabling) and doctrine (substantive or procedural). Using logistic regression, I find that Congress is more likely to choose substantive laws when faced with recent intelligence scandals. Congress is less likely to create a prohibitive law as support by the president’s party and the opposition party increases. These results are supported by the legislative history of a sample of these laws. I argue that these laws lead to a shift in covert action components that can best be explained through the interaction of principal-agent dynamics and the variation that exists in the perception that Congress’s laws are binding on the behavior of the executive and the national security agencies. To test this theory, I engage in process tracing of primary source documents of decision-making related to U.S. involvement in the Angolan civil war (1974-1989) and the Yugoslavian civil war (1992-1995). The results suggest that covert actions are modified in response to legal regulations, but sometimes in unanticipated ways that attempt to evade these laws. Substantive, prohibitive laws can result in an escalation of the violence of covert action, contrary to the intent of Congress. But procedural, prohibitive laws can caution decision-makers and slow escalation. Third parties, especially those invested in but not actively participating in the conflict, serve as a vital conduit for this covert activity but ensure an attenuated relationship to the U.S.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPolitical science. 4aLaw. 4aPublic policy.  aCase studies  aCovert action  aForeign policy  aIntelligence  aInternational security  aLaw  a0601  a0615  a0398  a063020aPrinceton University.bPolitics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2865088205720nam a2200529   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002100131245020400152260005800356300001100414500007800425500003600503502004800539506006900587506005900656520181900715520200202534590002304536650001604559650002804575650003004603650002104633650001904654653002304673653002704696653001804723653001604741653001204757653001904769653003904788690000904827690000904836690000904845690000904854690000904863710007404872773005104946790000904997791001005006792000905016793001505025856015005040AAI2865097620220920004333.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107298  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28650976  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aAcuna, Mauricio.10aPoeticas e Performances de Imaginacoes Afro-Atlanticas: O Primeiro Festival Mundial de Artes Negras =bPOETICS AND PERFORMANCES OF AFRO-ATLANTIC IMAGINATIONS:  THE FIRST WORLD FESTIVAL OF BLACK ARTS. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a437 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Monteiro, Pedro Meira.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis investigation identifies, describes and analyzes the poetics and performances of Afro-Atlantic imaginations and the diasporic practices created for, and disseminated by, the First World Festival of Black Arts that took place in Dakar in 1966. I track the development of a black internationalism in the South Atlantic and the cultural translation of aesthetic creations and anti-racist activism between the Americas and Africa. This research highlights the importance of the Festival to the promotion of artistic productions in the consolidation of a black internationalism in the 20th century and, more specifically, of an Afro-Latin American internationalism. In particular, I examine the relationship between Francophone blackness and ideologies of racial exceptionalism, such as Racial Democracy and Lusotropicalism. In this sense, I explore the Afro-Atlantic circulation of such ideas in the core context of a global Festival, which outlined new sensibilities, imaginations and alliances.I mobilize sources such as magazines, memoirs, diplomatic documents, correspondence, and ephemera to highlight the conditions of an emerging Afropolitanism in post-colonial Senegal and the effects of Afro-Atlantic politics and aesthetics in poetry, fiction, essay, speeches, images and performances. Five elements stand out: the formulation of a national foundation project, the negotiation of a postcolonial modernism, the proposition of a diplomacy based on the rhetoric of culture, the poetics and politics of Racial Democracy, Lusotropicalism and Negritude and the controversial role of Afro-Brazilian performances related to the Festival. This research contributes new perspectives on Afro-Atlantic cultural productions during an underexplored period of French, Spanish, and Portuguese interconnected negritudes.$=Esta investigacao dedica-se a identificar, descrever e analisar as poeticas e as performances de imaginacoes afro-atlanticas e as praticas diasporicas criadas no contexto do Primeiro Festival Mundial de Artes Negras realizado em Dacar, em 1966. Minha abordagem enfatiza a consolidacao de um internacionalismo negro no Atlantico sul e os esforcos de traducao cultural de criacoes esteticas e de um ativismo antirracista entre as Americas e a Africa, que se expressavam em portugues, pretugues, frances e espanhol. De maneira geral, a pesquisa ressalta a importancia do Festival como catalisador de producoes artisticas na consolidacao de um internacionalismo negro no seculo XX e, mais especificamente, de um internacionalismo afro-latino-americano. Ainda entre seus objetivos, este trabalho procura compreender as relacoes entre a negritude francofona e ideologias de excepcionalismo racial, como a democracia racial e o lusotropicalismo. Nesse sentido, exploro a circulacao afro-atlantica de tais ideias no bojo de um Festival de proporcoes globais, que delineou novas sensibilidades, imaginacoes e aliancas. Ressaltam-se, ainda, as condicoes de um afropolitanismo emergente no Senegal pos-colonial e os efeitos de politicas e esteticas afro-atlanticas em poesia, ficcao, ensaio, discursos, imagens e performances, mobilizando fontes documentais variadas, como periodicos, memorias, materiais diplomaticos, correspondencia e efemerides. Cinco elementos tem destaque: a formulacao de um projeto de fundacao nacional, a negociacao de um modernismo pos-colonial, a proposicao de uma diplomacia baseada na retorica da cultura, as poeticas e politicas da democracia racial, do lusotropicalismo e da Negritude e o papel controverso das performances afro-brasileiras no palco global de Dacar. Assim, espero contribuir com novas perspectivas sobre as producoes culturais afro-atlanticas, num momento ainda pouco explorado das interconexoes entre as negritudes de expressao francesa, espanhola e portuguesa.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aLiterature. 4aLatin American studies. 4aAfrican American studies. 4aPerforming arts. 4aBlack studies.  aAfro-Latin America  aBlack internationalism  aIntellectuals  aPerformance  aPoetics  aRace relations  aFirst World Festival of Black Arts  a0401  a0550  a0296  a0641  a032520aPrinceton University.bSpanish and Portuguese Languages and Cultures.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aPortuguese  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2865097603331nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002900131245015900160260005800319300001100377500007800388500003200466502004800498506005900546520169900605590002302304650002302327650001802350650002602368653003702394653003102431653001702462653004202479653002502521653003302546690000902579690000902588690000902597710003802606773005102644790000902695791001002704792000902714793001202723856015002735AAI2865156620220920004333.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107694  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28651566  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aRipberger, Hunter Hiatt.10aApplications of Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer in Organic Synthesis: Strategies for C(sp3)–H Bond Activation and Improved Reaction Quantum Efficiency. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a301 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Knowles, Robert R.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aProton-coupled electron transfer, or PCET, is a process described by the transfer of both a proton and an electron. This type of reactivity is established in biology as a fundamental method of accomplishing proton transfer, electron transfer, and radical transfer in proteins. A subclass of PCET reactions, known as concerted, multi-site PCETs, advantageously alters the thermodynamics and kinetics of bond homolysis, enabling the generation of open-shell intermediates under mild conditions. This dissertation describes two distinct applications of concerted, multi-site PCET in organic synthesis to yield highly reactive radical intermediates and to improve the lifetime of these intermediates in photoredox catalysis. In Chapter 2, a method for the homolysis of strong, C(sp3)–H bonds is described in the context of an intermolecular C–H alkylation, catalyzed by a cationic iridium(III) photocatalyst and anionic Bronsted base. In-depth mechanistic studies of the reaction demonstrate that ground state ion-pairing between the photo-oxidant and base enables the concerted activation of the C–H bond via multi-site PCET. In this case, ion-pairing is essential for lowering the kinetic barrier of the concerted activation step. In Chapter 3, redox relays built into the ligand framework of an iridium(III) photocatalyst are described and utilized to improve the quantum yield of a preparative scale photoredox reaction. These ligands are shown to undergo reversible PCET upon excitation of the catalyst, which enables long-lived charge separation and subsequently alters the thermodynamics and kinetics of charge recombination, leading to the observed improvement in reaction efficiency.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aOrganic chemistry. 4aBiochemistry. 4aChemical engineering.  aProton-coupled electron transfer  aConcerted, multi-site PCET  aApplications  aHighly reactive radical intermediates  aPhotoredox catalysis  aLong-lived charge separation  a0490  a0487  a054220aPrinceton University.bChemistry.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2865156602834nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001700131245008800148260005800236300001100294500007800305500003400383502004800417506005900465520142900524590002301953650002101976650001201997650002202009653002902031653001802060653002702078690000902105690000902114690000902123710005102132773005102183790000902234791001002243792000902253793001202262856015002274AAI2865170020220920004334.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107250  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28651700  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aHuang, Ding.10aBuilding Quantum Network Nodes Based on Neutral Silicon Vacancy Centers in Diamond. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a152 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: de Leon, Nathalie P.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aColor centers in diamond are attractive candidates for implementing single-atom quantum memories in a quantum network. This thesis describes an approach to build quantum networks nodes based on color centers in diamond. We propose to use a novel single-atom quantum memory, the neutral charge state of silicon vacancy (SiV0), as the building block for future quantum network. The unique combination of long spin coherence times and efficient optical transitions makes SiV0 a promising candidate for such application. Leveraging the excellent spin and optical properties of SiV0, we design a hybrid III-V diamond photonic platform that can both enhance the photon emission of SiV0 and perform on-chip frequency conversion to the telecommunication C-band. As a first step towards building quantum network nodes based on SiV0, we design, fabricate and characterize nanophotonic cavities on the GaAs-on-diamond platform. Preliminary results show that a quality factor of 1,328 can be achieved despite the challenges in fabrication. Coupling the cavity to a single SiV0 center in diamond could in principle enable a Purcell enhancement of the SiV0 emission with a factor of 64. This could potentially enhance spin readout and spin-photon entanglement fidelity for SiV0. Eventually, the results and techniques described in this thesis could contribute to the developments of multi-node quantum networks that span across the globe.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aQuantum physics. 4aOptics. 4aComputer science.  aColor centers in diamond  aNanophotonics  aQuantum networks nodes  a0599  a0752  a098420aPrinceton University.bElectrical Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2865170003730nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001800131245011300149260005800262300001100320500007800331500002800409502004800437506005900485520235500544590002302899650001902922653002002941653001502961653001802976653001102994690000903005690000903014690000903023690000903032710003803041773005103079790000903130791001003139792000903149793001203158856015003170AAI2865191720220920004334.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107618  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28651917  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aBaran, Cavit.10aEssays on Economic History of the United States: Evidence from the Pesticide Revolution and Great Migration. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a240 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Boustan, Leah.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis collection of essays examines two important episodes in the U.S. economic history. First two chapters explore health and economic legacy of pesticide revolution in the United States. Chapter 1 aims to understand how environmental legacy of modern farming will affect health of future generations and rural economies in the long term. To do so, I study historical lead and arsenic use in agriculture and their long-run effects on rural health and local economies. Combining historical farm data with death records for Pennsylvania farm households, I document farm-level exposure to lead and arsenic was linked to increased risk of mortality from cancers related to chronic arsenic exposure. I then show long-run health of individuals living in areas exposed to these substances in high levels was also impacted. Extending my analysis to 18 additional states, I find similar results. I provide suggestive evidence on relative decline in total farmland area, possibly due to increased soil toxicity, and in housing prices in affected areas after public became more aware of pesticides’ harmful effects.Chapter 2, co-authored with Maria Lucia Yanguas, explores how individuals react to new information about environmental quality. We investigate the effect of dissemination of environmental information on economic activity, exploiting the 1962 publication of environmental science book Silent Spring. We find that Silent Spring was associated with lower migration and farmland values in pesticide-intense areas, and ambiguous effects on house values. This supports the hypothesis that economic agents react to new information on environmental quality. Results are persistent over time.Chapter 3, co-authored with Eric Chyn and Bryan Stuart, studies the impact of the Great Migration on children. We use the complete-count 1940 Census to estimate selection-corrected place effects on education for children of Black migrants. On average, Black children gained 0.8 years of schooling (12 percent) by moving from South to North. Many counties that had the strongest positive impacts on children during the 1940s offer relatively poor opportunities for Black youth today. Opportunities for Black children were greater in places with more schooling investment, stronger labor market opportunities for Black adults, more social capital, and less crime.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPublic health.  aGreat Migration  aPesticides  aSilent Spring  aHealth  a0501  a0511  a0573  a050920aPrinceton University.bEconomics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2865191703983nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002200131245013400153260005800287300001100345500007800356500003300434502004800467506006900515506005900584520249200643590002303135653002403158653002403182653003003206653002703236653001903263653001603282690000903298710003703307773005103344790000903395791001003404792000903414793001203423856015003435AAI2865206220220920004334.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460486861  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28652062  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLevshin, Anatoly.14aThe Promise of a "Disentangling Alliance": Collective Security and the Statecraft of Violence in the Age of Industrial Modernity. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a438 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Ikenberry, G.

In this dissertation, I explore the reasons behind that decision and consider their implications for our understanding of the possibilities for, and limits to, decentralized violence cooperation. I shall argue that the founders of the League of Nations believed that the industrialization of international relations fundamentally transformed the logics of war and peace. They recognized that, with the advent of industrial modernity, the security of every state became dependent on the stability of the international system at large. And they devised collective security to cooperatively manage that dependence. But their expectations for collective security—or, indeed, their diagnosis of the strategic ramifications of the industrialization of international relations—cannot be understood in terms of familiar concepts and conjectures. To properly grasp them, and appreciate the broader possibilities for decentralized violence cooperation that the semi-centenarian experiment in collective security implies, we first need to enrich our conceptual vocabulary and causal grammar. One crucial addition that we require is the distinction between positional and systemic risks. In the particular case of violence, positional risks describe a state’s vulnerability to military attack, while the systemic risk of a strategy measures the cumulative expected instability in distributional settlements across all positional disputes in the international system that would ensue should that one strategy falter. Using this distinction, we can articulate the rationales of the founders precisely: they created collective security, I shall argue, to preserve their states against systemic risks induced by unreliable alliances. I shall further show that the distribution of systemic risks has been a crucial, if neglected, determinant of the patterns of rule-governed violence cooperation over the last two centuries—even beyond collective security. This analysis has important implications for our understanding of opportunities for, and limits to, decentralized cooperation. Most crucially, for rule-governed violence cooperation to be successful, its institutional design and distributional implications must be tailored to expected volatilities in topologies of systemic risk.  aSchool code: 0181.  aCoercive bargaining  aCollective security  aInternational cooperation  aInternational security  aInterstate war  aWorld order  a060120aPrinceton University.bPolitics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2865206204108nam a2200469   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002100131245007400152260005800226300001100284500007800295500004200373502004800415506005900463520142900522520001101951520110301962590002303065650002803088650001203116650002003128653004203148653002203190653002203212653002703234653002103261653002303282690000903305690000903314690000903323710006503332773005103397790000903448791001003457792000903467793001203476856015003488AAI2865214020220920004334.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107366  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28652140  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aChen, Timothy Y.10aIn Situ Time-Resolved Laser Diagnostics for Plasma Methane Reforming. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a143 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Kolemen, Egemen;Ju, Yiguang.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThere is significant interest in utilizing plasmas for reforming methane, a powerful greenhouse gas into larger hydrocarbons and useful chemicals using non-equilibrium plasmas powered by renewable electricity. However, the key reaction pathways and the plasma dynamics are not well understood due to lack of time-resolved in situ measurements in the literature for model validation. This demands the application and development of advanced laser diagnostics to provide critical experimental data for creating a quantitative understanding of the physics and chemistry of plasma CH4 reforming. In this dissertation, several different time-resolved laser diagnostics including Thomson scattering, electric field induced second harmonic generation (E-FISH), and spatially-resolved one-dimensional (1-D) hybrid femtosecond/picosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (fs/ps CARS) imaging of rotation-vibration non-equilibrium were developed and applied to identify the key physics and chemistry of CH4-containing pulsed plasmas. First, a sensitive Thomson/Raman scattering diagnostic was built to measure the time evolution of the electron properties in a CH4/He volumetrically uniform nanosecond-pulsed dielectric barrier discharge (ns-DBD) as well as vibrational temperature in a CH4/N2/He ns-DBD. The Thomson scattering instrument was able to measure electron temperatures of 0.5 eV and electron densities as low as 1x10.  a12 cm.  a(-3) Second, time-resolved multi-species laser absorption measurements were conducted to study the chemistry of plasma CH4/CO2 reforming. Both experimental species and electron properties data were used to develop and validate a 1-D plasma kinetic model of plasma CH4/CO2 reforming. Next, the plasma dynamics in the ns-DBD was studied through time-resolved electric field and electron properties measurements using E-FISH and Thomson scattering. Lastly, new fs/ps CARS diagnostics were developed for spatially resolved 1-D imaging of rotation-vibration non-equilibrium as well as 1-D thermometry using CH4 as the probe molecule. Time-domain fs/ps CARS modelling of the CH4 ν1 Q-branch enabled quantitative temperature measurements using CH4. Time and spatially-resolved fs/ps CARS measurements near the cathode of a CH4/N2 pin to pin discharge showed localized regions of high CH4 conversion and N2 vibrational temperature. Both of these fs/ps CARS diagnostics demonstrate significant potential in characterization of non-equilibrium molecular energy transfer near reacting gas-surface interfaces.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMechanical engineering. 4aOptics. 4aPlasma physics.  aCoherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering  aLaser diagnostics  aMethane reforming  aNon-equilibrium plasma  aPlasma chemistry  aThomson scattering  a0548  a0752  a075920aPrinceton University.bMechanical and Aerospace Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2865214003761nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002600131245006600157260005800223300001100281500007800292500002600370502004800396506005900444520230000503590002302803650002202826650002802848650002502876653003902901653001902940653003102959653003602990690000903026690000903035690000903044710004503053773005103098790000903149791001003158792000903168793001203177856015003189AAI2865234020220920004335.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107953  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28652340  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aSaxena, Raghuvansh R.10aCommunication Complexity: For Coding, Commerce, and Currents. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a603 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Kol, Gillat.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aSince its introduction in Yao's seminal paper [Yao79], communication complexity has revolutionized theoretical computer science. Indeed, not only has communication complexity been successful in areas where communication is an important resource, but it has also resulted in breakthroughs in areas that seemingly have nothing to do with communication! This is because bounds on communication can often be translated into bounds on other resources of interest, such as memory usage and circuit size.As the title suggests, we consider the role of communication complexity in the study of three different areas in theoretical computer science:Coding: Part I is about interactive error correcting codes, used to make interactive protocols resilient to noise. I study the noise tolerance of popular two-party and multi-party communication channels, constructing communication efficient codes with high noise tolerance for some of these channels, and proving that noise tolerance implies large communication overheads for others.Commerce: Part II studies communication problems in auction design, where the participating parties have their own interests and may not follow the protocol unless incentivized to do so. A common theme of this part is establishing tight separations between different classes of auctions, and understanding how various aspects of an auction affect its communication complexity.Currents: Part III covers my work on the memory requirement of graph streaming algorithms, which are algorithms whose input is a massive graph that they can only scan a few times. While algorithms that scan their input once are by now well understood, the situation is different for multi-pass streaming algorithms, which are the focus of this part of the thesis.Interestingly, each of these areas imposes additional requirements on the classical model of communication complexity: in interactive coding, we study communication complexity under noise; in auction design, we study communication complexity with incentives; and in multi-pass streaming, we consider communication complexity with few rounds of communication. While these three topics are seemingly very different, they all have strong connections with communication complexity, and studying them together often leads to deep insights.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aComputer science. 4aElectrical engineering. 4aInformation science.  aInteractive error correcting codes  aAuction design  aGraph streaming algorithms  aMulti-pass streaming algorithms  a0984  a0544  a072320aPrinceton University.bComputer Science.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2865234004024nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002400131245011300155260005800268300001100326500007800337500002900415502004800444506005900492520255100551590002303102650002203125650001603147650002503163653002103188653003703209653002603246653001703272690000903289690000903298690000903307710004503316773005103361790000903412791001003421792000903431793001203440856015003452AAI2865238120220920004335.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107588  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28652381  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aPlevrakis, Orestis.10aNew Exploration and Identification Schemes for Linear Dynamics: The Cases of Convex Costs and Censored Data. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a141 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Arora, Sanjeev.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aAdaptive control, i.e., learning to control an unknown linear dynamical system, has a long history in statistics and control theory. However, sharp non-asymptotic bounds were only recently obtained, and are outputs of an ongoing research program aiming to apply tools from learning theory and optimization, to control theory. A common feature of all the major results of the program has been the learning-part of the proposed algorithms, i.e., the exploration strategy. All these algorithms apply the so-called "certainty-equivalence", where the learner spends the first steps applying random controls (e.g. Gaussian noise), then estimates the dynamics via least-squares, and thereafter optimizes the control-policy using these estimates. Even though this is the simplest exploration strategy, it is optimal for the classical linear quadratic regulator (LQR). In this thesis, I study 1) the problem of adaptive control when the cost can be any convex function (thus generalizing LQR), and 2) the problem of learning a linear dynamical system (LDS) from "censored" observations, i.e., the state is observed only when it falls inside some set (e.g., the state can be the position of an object and the set can be the camera-frame). For the first problem, certainty-equivalence is suboptimal. For the second, the least-squares solution is not even consistent. The contribution of the thesis is the development of new computationally and statistically efficient algorithms for both problems. Specifically, 1. For adaptive control with convex costs, we consider the objective of regret with respect to the benchmark of stabilizing linear control policies. Leveraging ideas from convex geometry, we design an exploration strategy that achieves optimal regret, in terms of the dependence on the time-horizon. Our result improves upon the previous best known bounds, which correspond to algorithms applying certainty-equivalence. 2. In the problem of learning an LDS from censored observations, the learner observes the state xt in ℝd if and only if xt belongs to some set St  ⊆ ℝd. This setting was first considered by Lee and Maddala (1985), and Zeger and Brookmeyer (1986). We develop the first computationally and statistically efficient algorithm for learning the system, assuming only membership-oracle access to the sets St  (which can be arbitrarily complex sets, e.g., non-convex). Our algorithm, Stochastic Online Newton with Switching Gradients, is a novel second-order method that builds on the Online Newton Step of Hazan et al. (2007).  aSchool code: 0181. 4aComputer science. 4aStatistics. 4aApplied mathematics.  aAdaptive control  aLinear dynamical system learning  aCensored observations  aConvex costs  a0984  a0463  a036420aPrinceton University.bComputer Science.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2865238103562nam a2200433   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002300131245008500154260005800239300001100297500007800308500002900386502004800415506005900463520202900522590002302551650002502574650001302599650002902612653003802641653002102679653004002700653003002740653001602770690000902786690000902795690000902804710007402813773005102887790000902938791001002947792000902957793001202966856015002978AAI2865249920220920004335.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107311  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28652499  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aUysal, Ayse Sinem.10aRisk Budgeting Portfolios Under a Modern Optimization and Machine Learning Lens. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a166 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Mulvey, John M.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe mean-variance optimization framework has been the traditional approach to decide portfolio allocations based on return-risk trade-offs. However, it faces practical drawbacks, including sensitivity to estimated input parameters and concentration of portfolio risk. Risk budgeting portfolio optimization is a popular risk-based asset allocation  technique where risk budgets are assigned to each assets' risk contribution, and equalizing all risk budgets in the portfolio is known as risk parity strategy. Unlike mean-variance, the risk parity strategy provides a balanced risk concentration in the portfolio and does not require expected asset return estimates as input. However, its performance can depend on the selected asset universe. Furthermore, its mathematical formulation imposes some computational challenges due to the non-convex structure.In this thesis, the risk budgeting problem is studied with modern optimization and machine learning approaches to enhance the portfolio model and address the aforementioned challenges. The second chapter introduces regime-switching risk parity portfolios with two primary components: regime modeling and prediction with supervised learning methods and identifying a regime-based strategy to improve the performance of a nominal risk parity portfolio. In the third chapter, we formulate a multi-period risk parity portfolio optimization problem in a transaction cost environment with a model predictive control approach. We provide a successive convex program algorithm that provides faster and more robust solutions. Lastly, we present an end-to-end portfolio allocation method by embedding the risk budget optimization problem as an implicit layer in a neural network. This approach combines prediction and optimization tasks in a single decision-making pipeline and constructs dynamic risk budgeting portfolios. Furthermore, we introduce a novel asset selection property with stochastic gates that protects the risk budgeting portfolio against the unprofitable assets.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aOperations research. 4aFinance. 4aArtificial intelligence.  aEnd-to-end portfolio construction  aMachine learning  aMulti-period portfolio optimization  aRisk budgeting portfolios  aRisk parity  a0796  a0508  a080020aPrinceton University.bOperations Research and Financial Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2865249903585nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002200131245009700153260005800250300001100308500007800319500003500397502004800432506005900480520217800539590002302717650002202740653002802762653001302790653002102803653001502824653001202839653002002851690000902871690000902880710004502889773005102934790000902985791001002994792000903004793001203013856015003025AAI2865288520220920004335.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487486  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28652885  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMohan, Divyarthi.10aSimplicity and Optimality in Algorithmic Economics: Multi-Item Auctions and Social Learning. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a268 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Weinberg, S.

But in many settings, algorithms face an additional challenge: inputs are provided by strategic agents who may have different objectives than those of the algorithm designer. As a result, the field of algorithmic game theory emerged to understand and design algorithms in the presence of strategic agents. This thesis makes progress towards understanding simplicity in algorithmic game theory and when simplicity results in good outcomes; we focus on two main sub areas of algorithmic economics: multi-item auction theory and social learning.We consider the problem of revenue maximization when selling n items to a single unit-demand buyer. Unfortunately, optimal auctions for selling multiple items can be unreasonably complex and computationally intractable. Our work shows that simple mechanisms can achieve almost optimal revenue. We approach the tradeoffs of simplicity formally through the lens of computation and menu size. Our main result is a mechanism that gets a (1 - ε)-approximation to the optimal revenue in time quasi-polynomial in n.We also study how information aggregates in networks through simplemajority dynamics. We consider a model where agents make binary decisions, and each agent gets a private signal denoting which decision is better. Our main result proves that when the network is a tree formed according to the \\emph{preferential attachment model}, with high probability, the process stabilizes in a correct majority.Finally, we study a model of social learning between two Bayesian agents (a sender and a receiver) with limited/structured communication. In our model, to reflect real social exchanges, agents simply share a signal (or \\emph{anecdote}) they observed instead of sending arbitrary messages. A key result in our work shows that, when the agents have a fundamental difference, the optimal communication scheme can vary drastically (from sending the most representative anecdote to an extremely biased anecdote) depending on whether the receiver can observe the communication scheme used by the sender.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aComputer science.  aAlgorithmic game theory  aAuctions  aMechanism design  aPersuasion  aRevenue  aSocial learning  a0984  a050120aPrinceton University.bComputer Science.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2865288503819nam a2200481   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001800131245006100149260005800210300001100268500007800279500003700357502004800394506006900442506005900511520222900570590002302799650001902822650001602841650002902857650001602886653001802902653001802920653001402938653002002952653001302972653001402985690000902999690000903008690000903017690000903026710006103035773005103096790000903147791001003156792000903166793001203175856015003187AAI2865296320220920004336.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107236  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28652963  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aZhao, Zhilei.10aNeural Basis of Host Preference Evolution in Mosquitoes. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a185 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: McBride, Carolyn Lindy.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aAn animal’s fitness depends heavily on how it behaves in response to environmental stimuli. Behavior is therefore subject to strong selection and often evolves rapidly. Ever since Darwin, behavioral evolution has been studied extensively at the organismal level. However, we know very little about its proximate neural mechanisms. When behaviors need to change, how do the underlying neural circuits evolve accordingly? This is the central question for my dissertation work. My research takes advantage of a simple but powerful study system—the recent evolution of strong host preference in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Ae. aegypti was originated in Africa, but in less than 10,000 years, a form has evolved to specialize in biting humans, from the ancestral generalist form that bites diverse animal species, making it one of the most dangerous disease vectors. Mosquitoes rely primarily on olfaction to locate and discriminate hosts. Correspondingly, the specialist form has evolved a strong preference for human odor over the odor of nonhuman animals.How is host odor discrimination achieved at the neural level, and what have changed in the underlying circuits during specialization on human hosts? I first surveyed the literature broadly to list all possibilities (Chapter 1). I then developed several novel transgenic reagents with CRISPR/Cas9 to access the olfactory circuits in mosquitoes, in order to study behavior at the mechanistic level (Chapter 2). To understand how mosquitoes can discriminate human odor from animal odor, I first focused on the antennal lobe of the specialist mosquito (Chapter 3). By recording activity in the antennal lobe, I found a simple but robust neural code in the mosquito brain that distinguishes human odor from animal odor by stronger activation of a human-sensitive glomerulus. Lastly, I turned to the evolutionary question and compared the neuroanatomy of antennal lobe between the specialist and generalist mosquitoes (Chapter 4). I found broad reshaping of mosquito olfactory circuits during specialization on human hosts. Taken together, my dissertation research provides key insights to the neural mechanisms underlying host discrimination in mosquitoes and its evolution.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aNeurosciences. 4aEntomology. 4aEvolution & development. 4aBiophysics.  aAedes aegypti  aAntennal lobe  aEvolution  aHost preference  aMosquito  aOlfaction  a0317  a0353  a0412  a078620aPrinceton University.bEcology and Evolutionary Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2865296304136nam a2200457   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002400131245011400155260005800269300001100327500007800338500004600416502004800462506005900510520252500569590002303094650002203117650002603139650001703165650002803182653002403210653003303234653003003267653003303297653002603330690000903356690000903365690000903374690000903383710004503392773005103437790000903488791001003497792000903507793001203516856015003528AAI2871273320220920004336.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107472  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28712733  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMelissaris, Themis.10aTesting and Analyzing Correctness in Concurrent Systems: from Microprocessors to IoT and Distributed Systems. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a177 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Martonosi, Margaret;Shaw, Kelly.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aApplications such as the Internet of Things (IoT), multimedia streaming and self driving cars are drivers for explosive data growth. This data growth along with the slowdown of Moore's law presents new challenges for computing and spurs innovation for the next generation of hardware and software. To extract performance at manageable power, systems ranging from microprocessors to IoT devices and distributed systems increasingly leverage parallelism and concurrency. However, the performance and power benefits of parallelism come at the cost of increased complexity in designing, specifying and testing correctness of these systems.This dissertation draws insights across the domains of computer architecture, ΙοΤ and distributed systems, resulting in a set of practical tools and methodologies that allow for rigorous and efficient testing of correctness on multiprocessors, IoT systems and distributed systems.More specifically, this thesis introduces PerpLE, a tool that enables consistency testing for multiprocessors without per-iteration synchronization and relies on property based testing using litmus tests. This dissertation demonstrates how PerpLE speeds up testing performance by orders of magnitude against the state of the art, enabling fast error discovery in commercial microprocessors. Additionally, this dissertation presents Musli Tool, a practical tool for empirical consistency testing of distributed systems that leverages techniques and methodologies based on the computer architecture concept of litmus tests. Musli Tool automates testing by generating property-based tests and increases testing performance and fast portability in open source distributed systems. Finally, this thesis presents a study of rigorous concurrency testing on commercial and open source IoT systems. The study demonstrates correctness deficiencies of IoT systems and identifies the implications of race conditions,  lack of atomicity and weak consistency on applications. To mitigate erroneous behavior for IoT applications, the OKAPI tool is introduced.This dissertation presents how to vastly improve the performance and efficiency of consistency testing by leveraging a synchronization free variant of litmus tests and by developing tools to enable analysis and generation of tests based on this new methodology. This thesis also demonstrates how to take lessons learned from testing correctness in microprocessors and adapting to other domains of concurrent systems, particularly distributed systems and IoT.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aComputer science. 4aComputer engineering. 4aWeb studies. 4aInformation technology.  aConsistency testing  aDistributed Key-value stores  aMemory Consistency Models  aSynchronization-free testing  aTesting Methodologies  a0984  a0464  a0489  a064620aPrinceton University.bComputer Science.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871273304315nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001500131245008400146260005800230300001100288500007800299500002900377502004800406506005900454520276200513590002303275650002303298650002403321650002303345650002703368653002503395653003703420653004703457653002303504690000903527690000903536690000903545690000903554710006503563773005103628790000903679791001003688792000903698793001203707856015003719AAI2871286120220920004336.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107755  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28712861  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aXia, Yang.10aComputational Study of Structural Phase Transformations in Ultrathin Materials. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a169 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Haataja, Mikko.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aUltra-thin materials have shown tremendous potential in a wide variety of technological applications, such as flexible electronics, optoelectronics, and transparent devices. In this thesis, computational methods are employed to investigate the structural phase transformations in two different ultra-thin material systems: transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers and polymer thin films.In the study of TMD monolayers, we first focus on the mechanical behaviors related to the formation of the atomically thin group VI TMD superlattices.A combination of scaling theory and numerical analysis is employed to investigate strain relaxation mechanisms in misfitting, chemically heterogeneous TMDs. We demonstrate that, in free-standing superlattices, wrinkling of the monolayer is asymptotically preferred over misfit dislocation formation in both binary and ternary superlattices. For substrate-supported monolayers, however, misfit dislocation formation is thermodynamically favored above a critical superlattice width, implying the presence of an upper limit to the thermodynamic stability of coherent, misfitting 2D superlattices.Based on the study of superlattice strain relaxation, we further developed our phase-field model to explore the possibility of phase programming via defects in TMD monolayers. Three different kinds of experimentally available defects, combining with macroscopic in-plane strains, are investigated to facilitate the localization of phase transformations in TMD monolayers. Quantitative relations between the macroscopic strain requirement, phase transformation patterning, and the defect configurations are developed via theoretical analysis and then verified with numerical simulations.To better understand the phase transformations in TMD monolayers, a phase-field crystal model is developed to study the phase transformations between the 2H and 1T structures from an atomistic perspective in TMD monolayers. Geometric analysis and numerical simulations are conducted to find the possible defects induced by the phase transformations. Moreover, the relation between the density of linear defects and the dynamic of the periodic phase transformation is obtained numerically and explained theoretically.With respect to the polymer thin film, the epitaxial crystallization behaviors observed in experiments are investigated. A phase-field model with anisotropic kinetics and interfacial energies is developed. With this phase-field model, both the formation of the spherulite in the polymer droplet and epitaxial needles in the polymer thin film can be reproduced. Additionally, the quantitative relations between the epitaxial needles width, polymer diffusivity, growth rate, and polymer molecular weight are determined.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMaterials science. 4aPhysical chemistry. 4aPolymer chemistry. 4aComputational physics.  aUltra-thin materials  aStructural phase transformations  aTransition metal dichalcogenide monolayers  aPolymer thin films  a0794  a0216  a0495  a049420aPrinceton University.bMechanical and Aerospace Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871286103456nam a2200433   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100003500131245006300166260005800229300001100287500007800298500003200376502004800408506005900456520200700515590002302522650002202545650002902567650001902596653002602615653002302641653002102664653002202685690000902707690000902716690000902725690000902734710003802743773005102781790000902832791001002841792000902851793001202860856015002872AAI2871307820220920004336.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108424  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28713078  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aSorg-Langhans, George Leopold.10aEssays on Machine Learning Methods and Household Dynamics. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a160 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Rogerson, Richard.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation consists of three independent chapters on questions surrounding household dynamics and machine learning methods developed to address them.In the first chapter, which is co-authored with Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde, Galo Nuno, and Maximilian Vogler, we develop a deep-learning algorithm to globally solve high-dimensional dynamic programming problems that arise in macroeconomic models. This approach allows us to address household dynamics in a rich environment driven by both aggregate and idiosyncratic uncertainty. We evaluate our methodology in a standard neoclassical growth model and then demonstrate its power in two high-dimensional applications -- a model of dynamic capital allocation and a model of migration and labor mobility. In the second chapter I propose a new machine learning approach to understanding consumption insurance of households, a central issue in the context of household dynamics. I draw on a state-of-the-art machine learning method, gradient boosted trees, to predict consumption in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. With the resulting panel data set in hand, I adopt Blundell, Pistaferri, and Preston's (2008) assumptions about the underlying permanent-transitory income process, which allows me to estimate insurance coefficients. Importantly, I find qualitative and quantitative differences to their insurance predictions.In the third chapter, which is co-authored with Riccardo Cioffi, and Maximilian Vogler, we investigate how different theories of wealth inequality interact with important policy experiments. To this end, we calibrate four models, each incorporating a different inequality-generating channel emphasized in the theoretical literature, and compare their predictions regarding different policy experiments. We find stark quantitative and qualitative differences in predictions across channels for a given policy experiment, indicating that analyzing their relative importance is crucial to our understanding of wealth inequality.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aComputer science. 4aArtificial intelligence. 4aPublic policy.  aConsumption insurance  aHousehold dynamics  aMachine learning  aWealth inequality  a0501  a0984  a0630  a080020aPrinceton University.bEconomics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871307804026nam a2200469   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001500131245009800146260005800244300001100302500007800313500004400391502004800435506006900483506005900552506006700611520236100678590002303039650002303062650001303085650001803098650001603116653003103132653002003163653002503183653002503208690000903233690000903242690000903251690000903260710004603269773005103315790000903366791001003375792000903385793001203394856015003406AAI2871314020220920004337.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107342  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28713140  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLi, Anran.10aRegulation of Secondary Metabolism by Low Doses of Antibiotics in Burkholderia thailandensis. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a269 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Seyedsayamdost, Mohammad (Mo).  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aMicrobial secondary metabolites, or natural products, have served as a critical source for modern drug development. Recent genome analyses show the majority of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which are responsible for secondary metabolite production, remain unexpressed under normal culture conditions. Investigation into these “cryptic” BGCs and deciphering the regulatory mechanism could shed light on exploring strategies to discover new natural products.We addressed this question in the Gram-negative model bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis. Previous studies identified elicitors with distinct modes of action, including the antibiotics trimethoprim, β-lactams, and fluoroquinolones. We first characterized the mechanism underlying the stimulatory effect of trimethoprim and found low doses induced global changes in the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolomes. Low-dose trimethoprim treatment affected methionine biosynthesis, leading to the accumulation of the precursor homoserine, which in turn activated the silent malleilactone BGC through the pathway-specific regulator MalR. We next characterized the signaling pathway for β-lactam piperacillin. The stimulatory activity of piperacillin, and a family of β-lactams, correlated with its growth-inhibitory effect. Specifically, piperacillin induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to DNA damage and the oxidative stress response, which through OxyR activated the silent malleilactone BGC, again via MalR. Our results, therefore, established a link between the oxidative stress response and secondary metabolism in B. thailandensis.Additionally, we explored the mechanism of induction of fluoroquinolones. Fluoroquinolones induce DNA damage and the SOS response in B. thailandensis. The SOS and oxidative stress responses partially explained fluoroquinolones’ elicitation. Subsequent transcriptomic studies revealed a novel transcriptional regulator related with oxidative stress is also involved in the regulatory network. Finally, we employed transposon mutagenesis and a high-throughput reporter guided screening approach to identify regulators of secondary metabolism. We find that the phage growth limitation (Pgl) system and the tight adherence (Tad) system genes are involved in secondary metabolism regulation, while future investigation is undergoing.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMolecular biology. 4aBiology. 4aPharmacology. 4aBiophysics.  aBurkholderia thailandensis  aNatural product  aRegulatory mechanism  aSecondary metabolism  a0307  a0306  a0786  a041920aPrinceton University.bMolecular Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871314003607nam a2200361   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001500131245005800146260005800204300001100262500007800273500002900351502004800380506005900428520238100487590002302868650001302891653002802904653001602932690000902948690000902957710003802966773005103004790000903055791001003064792000903074793001203083856015003095AAI2871344420220920004337.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487288  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28713444  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aYu, Yifan.10aEssays on Institutional Investors in the Bond Market. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a141 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Yogo, Motohiro.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis thesis consists of three chapters on institutional investors in bond market. Chapter 1 examines duration hedging behavior in corporate bond market by studying investment decisions of life insurance companies, the largest institutional investors in this market. I find that life insurers are tilting their corporate bond portfolios towards bonds with higher duration as interest rates decrease to historical lows since the 2008 financial crisis. This hunt-for-duration behavior is due to life insurers’ interest rate risk hedging to ensure better duration matching between their assets and liabilities.  I further show that hunt-for-duration by life insurers can drive overpricing of corporate bonds when negative monetary policy surprises hit. Chapter 2 investigates how the risk-based capital (RBC) reform in insurance industry initiated in year 1993 affects life insurers' investment behavior in corporate bonds, and how RBC-induced distortion in insurers' investment practices could have an impact on credit allocation, and ultimately real investment in the economy. Following the reform, I observe that insurers tilt their portfolios towards the lowest rated corporate bonds within a bond risk category defined by the RBC rule. Through shifting insurers' bond demand, I find that the RBC reform changes the credit supply conditions to a particular group of firms: those that have credit ratings barely fitting into a low-risk category and belong to industries where insurers hold more corporate bonds before the reform. Furthermore, I find that these firms take advantage of the more favorable credit allocation conditions to increase investment and employment after the reform. These results highlight a channel through which regulatory reform in insurance industry can bear real consequences.Chapter 3 studies whether life insurers rebalance their bond portfolios during Quantitative Easing (QE) programs initiated by the Federal Reserve (Fed) since the 2008 financial crisis. I find that life insurers sell QE securities and replace them with corporate bonds over certain QE periods. Moreover, life insurers rebalance toward corporate bonds in the lowest rating tier within a risk category defined by the RBC rule under which insurers are regulated.

Anarchists drew on liberal ideals and constitutional freedoms to agitate in favor of revolution, which in turn encouraged officials to deploy new techniques of surveillance and control. At the same time, anarchist activism offered pretexts and sometimes inspiration for new authoritarian movements that sought power after 1917. Far from being quixotic rebels, anarchists catalyzed a revolution—one they did not intend—during the era of the First World War.A political and intellectual history informed by political science, sociology, and social history, this dissertation argues that anarchists and regimes made, as much as fought, one another. It documents a transnational struggle between revolutionaries and rulers across Spain, Italy, and the Russian Empire/Soviet Union. The plot spans the 1870s and 1930s, focusing on 1917–23, an era of civil unrest followed by the imposition of a dictatorship in each country. The cast features those who promoted, and those who fought, the far left: militants and police chiefs, propagandists and provincial governors, rank-and-file constituents and intellectuals, assassins and cabinet ministers. Sources include politicians' writings, interior ministry records, trade-union files, newspapers, pamphlets, manifestos, and memoirs. Seven chapters investigate how left-wing activists, their political rivals, and state officials competed for influence, how anarchists articulated a resilient imaginary and built dynamic organizations, and how anarchist sensibilities inflected Soviet institutions, disappeared and then reappeared among western nonconformists, and informed new approaches in political sociology.Traditionally, historians treated anarchists as "petit-bourgeois" artisans and peasants, while political theorists made them timeless figures in "anti-statist" genealogies stretching back to Laozi. Recent scholarship rehabilitates globe-trotting activists who animated students in 1968 and contemporary protest movements (Neozapatismo, Occupy, Antifa). Such approaches all presume that anarchists were the enemies of power. By contrast, this dissertation suggests that anarchists were also the subjects and agents of power. In so doing, it uses anarchism to illuminate how politics became modern.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aEuropean history. 4aRussian history. 4aSociology.  aAnarchism  aGlobal history  aGovernance  aPolitical violence  aRadicalism  aSocialism  a0335  a0724  a062620aPrinceton University.bHistory.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871345203301nam a2200433   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002200131245010500153260005800258300001100316500007800327500002600405502004800431506006900479506005900548520172600607590002302333650002302356650002902379650001802408653003002426653003402456653004702490653001602537690000902553690000902562690000902571710004602580773005102626790000902677791001002686792000902696793001202705856015002717AAI2871399420220920004337.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108318  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28713994  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aKing, Sean Burak.10aComparative Genomic Approaches for Characterizing Protein-Ligand Interfaces across the Tree of Life. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a118 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Singh, Mona.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aMany of the biological functions that serve as the foundation of life occur at the interfaces of proteins and their ligands. The fundamental importance of protein-ligand interfaces suggests that they may play a role in the phenotypic variation observed across species. Recent advances in the speed with which genomes are sequenced and protein structures are solved enables the high-throughput study of these interfaces at a scale that has not previously been possible; this dissertation leverages these data to answer two questions about protein-ligand interfaces. First, to what degree can protein residues that mediate interactions with viral proteins evolve in mammals that are engaging in an evolutionary arms race with more rapidly evolving viral pathogens and does this reflect the variable susceptibility of different hosts to viral infections? Second, how do amino acids that comprise protein-ligand interfaces vary over evolutionary time, and do we see differential patterns of variation when considering residues that bind different ligands? We tackle the first of these two questions by analyzing the family of mammalian proteins that can be bound by the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and the second of these questions by analyzing more than 1000 one-to-one orthologous gene groups across 18 primate species. Overall, the findings herein show that protein-ligand interfaces are capable of evolving in response to viral infections over evolutionary timescales, and that while ligand-binding sites are generally strongly conserved in primates, ligand interfaces that do vary are enriched in proteins responsible for critical biological processes that are associated with strong phenotypic effects.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMolecular biology. 4aEvolution & development. 4aBiochemistry.  aProtein-ligand interfaces  aEvolution of protein residues  aVariable susceptibility to viral infection  aAmino acids  a0307  a0412  a048720aPrinceton University.bMolecular Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871399403779nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002600131245007000157260005800227300001100285500007800296500002700374502004800401506005900449520232800508590002302836650002302859650002502882653001502907653002302922653001602945653001802961653002202979653001703001690000903018690000903027690000903036690000903045710003803054773005103092790000903143791001003152792000903162793001203171856015003183AAI2871405820220920004338.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108486  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28714058  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aParihar, Parth Singh.10aEssays in Dynamic Cooperation: Bargaining and Contribution Games. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a162 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Yariv, Leeat.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aIn many economic and political settings, agents with non-aligned interests must work together to enact mutually beneficial change. My dissertation consists of three chapters that analyze problems that combine features of bargaining and contribution games. In particular, I examine how institutional rules, the size of teams, and the attitudes of agents affect dynamic cooperation.In Chapter 1, I analyze a repeated bargaining environment where the previously negotiated agreement becomes the present status quo. Agreements’ efficiency decays in the absence of revision, giving both parties an incentive to re-negotiate. I study how limited foresight— or the inability of agents to account for the full dynamic linkage from one agreement to the next— affects behavior. I show that limited foresight is a key driver of gridlock. Moreover, I demonstrate that while limited foresight and inter-temporal discounting both overweight imminent outcomes, these have the opposite effects on equilibrium. I solve the model in the case of legislative bargaining and relate its findings to observed phenomena in policy-making.In Chapter 2, Matias Iaryczower, Santiago Oliveros, and I study sequential contributions to public goods. We consider a model where agents with different valuations for the good are selected at random to contribute in each period. Agents face classical free-riding incentives in preferring to offload the cost of contributing to other players. We show that if the project is sufficiently large, the unique equilibrium of the model displays endogenous contribution cycles, in which agents of different types alternate making gradual contributions towards completion of the project.Finally, in Chapter 3, I explore a setting that combines features of both bargaining and contribution games. Two players cooperate to complete a joint project, wherein each of several periods, one agent— the project leader— is responsible for advancing the project at personal cost. Project leaders are choose not only the extent of progress they enact but also the direction in which the project moves, over which their preferences diverge with their counterparts. I show that increasing the incumbency of an efficient project leader decreases her productivity while the opposite is true for an inefficient contributor.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPolitical science. 4aApplied mathematics.  aBargaining  aContribution games  aCooperation  aDynamic games  aPolitical economy  aPublic goods  a0511  a0615  a0703  a036420aPrinceton University.bEconomics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871405803314nam a2200433   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002100131245007000152260005800222300001100280500007800291500003000369502004800399506005900447520190200506590002302408650002602431650001602457650002802473653001402501653001602515653001202531653001302543653001702556690000902573690000902582690000902591710003902600773005102639790000902690791001002699792000902709793001202718856015002730AAI2871426920220920004338.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108059  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28714269  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLiquin, Emily G.10aImperfect Inquiry: How Curiosity and Satisfaction Guide Learning. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a256 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Lombrozo, Tania.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aHumans are remarkably effective learners, and we are particularly unique in our desire to understand why and how things happen. Why do humans pursue explanations with such fervor? In this dissertation, I explore the phenomenological state that drives learners to pursue explanations (explanation-seeking curiosity) and the phenomenological state that signals inquiry has succeeded (explanatory satisfaction)—the states that together comprise "explanatory phenomenology." In Chapter 1, I present several competing accounts of explanatory phenomenology, which posit different connections between explanatory phenomenology and the goal of learning useful explanations. In Chapters 2-4, I test these accounts. In Chapter 2, I report empirical evidence that explanation-seeking curiosity is related to individuals’ reported expectations that inquiry will lead to useful learning, above and beyond heuristic cues to learning. In Chapter 3, I show that explanation-seeking curiosity is related to expected learning/uncertainty about the query of interest, as operationalized by an optimal model. However, the optimal utility of information and optimal expected learning about a global target of inquiry are less consistently associated with curiosity. In Chapter 4, I report evidence that explanatory satisfaction is associated with perceived learning but is less consistently related to several measures of actual learning. In Chapter 5, I summarize these results and explore their implications for understanding when and why humans experience explanatory phenomenology. Taken together, this work supports the view that explanatory phenomenology is an imperfect motivating force behind useful learning. By experiencing explanatory phenomenology and pursuing inquiry, learners are guided towards asking questions that have strong but fallible potential to lead to informative and useful explanations.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aCognitive psychology. 4aPsychology. 4aEducational psychology.  aCuriosity  aExplanation  aInquiry  aLearning  aSatisfaction  a0633  a0621  a052520aPrinceton University.bPsychology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871426903517nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001300131245007600144260005800220300001100278500007800289500002900367502004800396506005900444520210300503590002302606650002202629650002902651650002502680653001902705653002002724653002102744653001702765690000902782690000902791690000902800710004502809773005102854790000902905791001002914792000902924793001202933856015002945AAI2871489720220920004338.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108073  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28714897  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aHu, Wei.10aUnderstanding Deep Learning via Analyzing Dynamics of Gradient Descent. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a340 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Arora, Sanjeev.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe phenomenal successes of deep learning build upon the mysterious abilities of gradient-based optimization algorithms. Not only can these algorithms often successfully optimize complicated non-convex training objectives, but the solutions found can also generalize remarkably well to unseen test data despite significant over-parameterization of the models. Classical approaches in optimization and generalization theories that treat empirical risk minimization as a black box are insufficient to explain these mysteries in modern deep learning. This dissertation illustrates how we can make progress toward understanding optimization and generalization in deep learning by a more refined approach that opens the black box and analyzes the dynamics taken by the optimizer. In particular, we present several theoretical results that take into account the learning dynamics of the gradient descent algorithm.In the first part, we provide global convergence guarantees of gradient descent for training deep linear networks under various initialization schemes. Our results characterize the effect of width, depth and initialization on the speed of optimization. In addition, we identify an auto-balancing effect of gradient flow, which we prove to hold generally in homogeneous neural networks (including those with ReLU activation).In the second part, we study the implicit regularization induced by gradient descent, which is believed to be the key to mathematically understanding generalization in deep learning. We present results in both linear and non-linear neural networks, which characterize how gradient descent implicitly favors simple solutions.In the third part, we focus on the setting where neural networks are over-parameterized to have sufficiently large width. Through the connection to neural tangent kernels, we perform a fine-grained analysis of optimization and generalization, which explains several empirically observed phenomena. Built on these theoretical principles, we further design a new simple and effective method for training neural networks on noisily labeled data.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aComputer science. 4aArtificial intelligence. 4aApplied mathematics.  aGeneralization  aLearning theory  aMachine learning  aOptimization  a0984  a0800  a036420aPrinceton University.bComputer Science.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871489704032nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001800131245012000149260005800269300001100327500007800338500003300416502004800449506006900497506005900566520251500625590002303140650002303163653001403186653001903200653002803219653002503247653002703272653001503299690000903314690000903323710003703332773005103369790000903420791001003429792000903439793001203448856015003460AAI2871492420220920004338.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487318  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28714924  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aFoster, Noel.10aDigital Disruption and Revisionist Statecraft: How Revisionist Powers Shape Their Adversaries’ Domestic Politics. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a208 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Friedberg, Aaron L.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aHow do revisionist states influence domestic preferences in target states to shape the targets’ foreign policy? My dissertation tests three novel theories through the lens of revisionist statecraft: the “hybrid” use of the non-military domains of information, influence, and cyber operations to shape domestic preferences in the target state and from that their foreign policy. At the level of the international system, I posit that certain authoritarian states contest not only their national interests, but their role in the international system and the norms of an international order they deem structurally disadvantage them. These revisionist states, lacking superiority in the determinants of superiority in great power competition, seek relative, rather, than absolute, power gains, in a policy of balancing by off-balancing opponents. Unable to influence elites, revisionist states circumvent the musing new technologies to shape foreign audiences’ political attitudes and preferences directly, with the goal of polarization to block winning coalitions.The introductory chapter argues that technological innovation empowers revisionist strategies aimed at disrupting their adversaries’ decision-making processes. Revisionist powers seek to maximize the disruption of the adversary’s decision-making processes and minimize the likelihood of retribution through attribution manipulation. Finally, within the subset of information and influence operations, the objective of information and influence operations is polarization of the domestic audience, not persuasion. Rather than persuading skeptical audiences, the goal instead is to turn receivers against one another and the state, and to sow epistemological nihilism that weakens belief in any shared truth.The dissertation tests these theories through three empirical chapters. Chapter 2, “Unbounded War,” critically examines Russian strategic thought, its lessons and its influence. Chapter 3, “Propaganda Gone Viral,” relies on Russia and China’s reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic to test how these revisionist states react to crises and turn them to their advantage in the informational sphere, polarizing audiences and sowing epistemological nihilism. Chapter 4, “Polarization for Paralysis,” shows the mechanisms behind Russian online information operations in Estonia, providing evidence for the theory of polarization, rather than persuasion, as well as intentionality in the Kremlin’s use of strategic narratives.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPolitical science.  aFake news  aGrand strategy  aGreat power competition  aInfluence operations  aInformation operations  aStatecraft  a0601  a061520aPrinceton University.bPolitics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871492403695nam a2200481   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002200131245009100153260005800244300001100302500007800313500002800391502004800419506006900467506005900536506006700595520200800662590002302670650002402693650003202717650002102749650002002770653002002790653002302810653002102833653001802854653002002872653001702892690000902909690000902918690000902927710003602936773005102972790000903023791001003032792000903042793001203051856015003063AAI2871500720220920004339.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108356  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28715007  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMinnen, Jennifer.14aThe Second Science: Feminist Natural Inquiry in Nineteenth-Century British Literature. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a230 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Nord, Deborah.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aRevising commonplaces about where science happened, who pursued it, and why, “The Second Science” argues that nineteenth-century women writers used the daily work of natural history— collection, correspondence, and exchange—to challenge public discourse surrounding ‘The Woman Question.’ Much scholarship on gender and science recuperates female contributors, yet, dependent on canonical texts and traditional forms of publication, maintains separate spheres and secondary roles. In contrast, “The Second Science” highlights the egalitarian exchange networks that informed scientific practice and the material forms through which such practices developed, revealing the porousness of our entrenched paradigms of domesticity and scientific professionalism. By digging into botanical and zoological archives, the dissertation interrogates this culture of circulation and specimen in the novels of Maria Edgeworth, George Eliot, and Olive Schreiner and through the photographic books of Anna Atkins, tracing an arc of feminist natural inquiry across a century in which new scientific theories of classification, environment, and development arose alongside contested questions about a woman’s place in a changing world. For these authors, plants sent by post and polyps plucked for home aquaria became intellectual currency, opening unexpected channels into public debate about sex difference (or what we now call gender) from within the family parlor. Material practice with the methods and tools of natural history then led the three novelists in the dissertation to develop in their fiction experimental orientations to female character through which they could critique and re-imagine women’s rights and roles in society. By examining these literary experiments, “The Second Science” proposes an expanded feminist genealogy of nineteenth-century women writers who undertake scientific inquiry to challenge contemporary ideas about a woman’s nature as a means of social reform.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aEnglish literature. 4aBritish & Irish literature. 4aScience history. 4aWomens studies.  aNatural history  aThe Woman Question  aEdgeworth, Maria  aEliot, George  aShreiner, Olive  aAtkins, Anna  a0593  a0585  a045320aPrinceton University.bEnglish.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871500703885nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002700131245009700158260005800255300001100313500007800324500002300402502004800425506005900473520246500532590002302997650002603020650002003046653002403066653002003090653001203110653001103122653002203133690000903155690000903164710006103173773005103234790000903285791001003294792000903304793001203313856015003325AAI2871540320220920004339.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487622  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28715403  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aSmyth, Jane Elizabeth.10aInvestigating the Physical Controls of Monsoon Seasonality in a Hierarchy of Climate Models. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a161 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Ming, Yi.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aMonsoons supply the majority of annual rainfall to land regions across the tropics and play a prominent role in global climate. Despite this, we lack a complete mechanistic understanding of monsoon characteristics and how they might change with warming. This dissertation draws on theory and a range of climate models to elucidate the physics governing monsoon circulations.First, we investigate the seasonally dependent responses of the South American monsoon to warming. In the latest Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Atmospheric Model (AM4), uniform 2-K sea surface temperature warming reduces precipitation by 11%, and precipitation minus evaporation by 40%, in the monsoon onset season, producing a more severe dry season. A column-integrated moist static energy budget analysis helps elucidate the drying mechanism. By comparing the response across seasons we identify two necessary conditions for a region to exhibit a substantial drying response to warming.To better understand the seasonal and global variations in monsoon circulations, Chapter 3 utilizes an idealized modeling framework. We systematically vary the moisture and albedo parameters over an isolated South American continent with reduced heat capacity, but no topography. Irrespective of the local moisture availability, the seasonal cycles of precipitation and circulation over the monsoon sector are distinctly monsoonal with the default surface albedo, but with differing characteristics and dynamical mechanisms. The analysis supports that when the land-ocean thermal contrast is strong enough, inertial instability is sufficient for producing a shallow but vigorous circulation and converging a large amount of moisture from the ocean. Once the land is sufficiently moist, convective instability takes hold and the shallow circulation deepens. Chapter 4 investigates the monsoonal precipitation over a dry continent on synoptic timescales, and provides additional evidence for the importance of inertial instability.In Chapter 5, we utilize an Earth System Model (ESM4.1) to investigate changes in precipitation and aridity over the South American monsoon sector in future emissions scenarios. The projected runoff reductions have implications for energy system planning in Brazil, where 60–80% of monthly power generation comes from hydropower. The possibility of seasonal power generation deficits underscores the importance of climate risk management in the energy sector.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aAtmospheric sciences. 4aClimate change.  aHydroclimate change  aModel hierarchy  aMonsoon  aPolicy  aTropical dynamics  a0725  a040420aPrinceton University.bAtmospheric and Oceanic Sciences.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871540302751nam a2200349   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001700131245005400148260005800202300001100260500007800271500002800349502004800377506005900425520153800484590002302022650002202045653001702067653002202084690000902106710004502115773005102160790000902211791001002220792000902230793001202239856015002251AAI2871572620220920004339.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487370  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28715726  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLiu, Qipeng.10aCryptography in the Age of Quantum Computers 2.0. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a603 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Zhandry, Mark.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aPeople widely believe that full-scale quantum computers will eventually be viable in the near future. Quantum computers pose threats to many existing cryptosystems (most prominently, Shor's algorithm) while raising the possibility of using quantum-mechanical phenomena to achieve never-before-possible capabilities.First, I will present my work on quantum query complexity: I will show tight bounds for multi-collision finding problems and tight time-space tradeoffs for function inversion problems. The latter indicates that Grover's search cannot be sped up even with a piece of preprocessed quantum advice. This technique can be extended to prove the post-quantum non-uniform security of many existing cryptographic schemes.Second, I will present my work on post-quantum zero-knowledge proof. I will start by showing that post-quantum constant-round zero-knowledge protocols for NP with black-box simulators do not exist in the plain model unless NP is in BQP. Then, I will show how to achieve non-interactive zero-knowledge in the quantum random oracle model by proving that the famous Fiat-Shamir transformation is secure.Third, I will present my work on quantum copy-protection, which aims to use the unclonability of quantum states to achieve programs that cannot be copied. Towards this goal, I will show that any unlearnable function can be copy-protected relative to classical oracles. For specific cryptographic functionalities (such as signatures and RPFs), I will show that they can be copy-protected in the plain model.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aComputer science.  aCryptography  aQuantum computing  a098420aPrinceton University.bComputer Science.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871572603113nam a2200433   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002500131245006200156260005800218300001100276500007800287500005800365502004800423506005900471520161800530590002302148650002302171650002402194650002702218653001202245653002602257653001602283653002502299653004102324690000902365690000902374690000902383710004602392773005102438790000902489791001002498792000902508793001202517856015002529AAI2871642020220920004340.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107908  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28716420  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aDoherty, Caroline A.10aDynamics of Collective Growth in the Drosophila Germline. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a101 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Shvartsman, Stanislav Y.;Gavis, Elizabeth R.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aDeveloping oocytes need large supplies of macromolecules and organelles. A conserved strategy for accumulating these products is to pool resources of oocyte-associated nurse cells. In Drosophila, these cells grow more than 100-fold to boost their biosynthetic capacity. No previously known mechanism explains how nurse cells coordinate growth collectively. In this thesis I report a cell cycle-regulating mechanism that depends on bidirectional communication between the oocyte and nurse cells, revealing the oocyte as a critical regulator of germline cyst growth. Transcripts encoding the Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Dacapo are synthesized by the nurse cells and actively localized to the oocyte. Retrograde movement of oocyte-synthesized Dacapo protein to the nurse cells generates a network of coupled oscillators that controls the cell cycle of the nurse cells to regulate cyst growth. I propose that bidirectional nurse cell-oocyte communication establishes a growth sensing feedback mechanism that regulates the quantity of maternal resources loaded into the oocyte. Furthermore, the nurse cells are not the only cells that engage in bidirectional communication with the oocyte. I present preliminary findings on how the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton in the germline and overlying somatic follicle cells may coordinate growth of these two tissues. Finally, I expand on these experimental findings to discuss comparisons between Drosophila and mouse oogenesis and propose that bidirectional communication between oocytes and support cells is a universal feature of oogenesis across species.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMolecular biology. 4aSystematic biology. 4aDevelopmental biology.  aOocytes  aCell cycle-regulation  aNurse cells  aGermline cyst growth  aBidirectional cellular communication  a0307  a0423  a075820aPrinceton University.bMolecular Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871642003758nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001900131245004900150260005800199300001100257500007800268500002900346502004800375506005900423520227500482590002302757650001802780650001502798650001702813653002102830653002402851653002002875653001702895653003102912653005002943690000902993690000903002690000903011710005103020773005103071790000903122791001003131792000903141793001203150856015003162AAI2871653820220920004340.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108479  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28716538  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aBouma, Luke G.10aOrigins and Fates of Close-In Giant Planets. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a266 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Winn, Joshua N.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe exoplanet census has revealed a diversity of worlds far beyond that of the solar system. This work aims to advance our empirical understanding of the evolutionary processes responsible for this diversity.Chapters 2 and 3 focus on the final tidal inspirals of hot Jupiters. Using transit timing measurements from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we found that the apparent orbital period of the hot Jupiter WASP-4b is slowly shrinking. Care was warranted however before claiming a detection of tidal orbital decay. In our case, we showed that the data were best explained through a Doppler-like effect caused by an outer planet or brown dwarf; future searches for tidal orbital decay will need to account for similar effects.Chapters 4 through 7 are oriented around the discovery of young short-period giant planets. While thousands of planets have been discovered, most are between one and ten billion years old. These chapters introduce a Cluster Difference Imaging Photometric Survey that uses TESS to find planets around stars in coeval groups younger than one billion years. Most of the targeted stars are in open clusters that are poorly resolved by TESS, so we built our own difference-imaging data reduction pipeline (Chapter 4).Three results based on the data products are highlighted. First, PTFO 8-8695b, a 10 Myr (million-year) old candidate hot Jupiter whose planetary status has been debated for nearly a decade, is not a planet (Chapter 5). The rejection of PTFO 8-8695b implies that the existence of sub-100 Myr old hot Jupiters is an open question. Second, based on TESS transits and ground-based follow-up, the 40 Myr old Saturn-sized TOI 837b is likely a planet (Chapter 6). Its size (8.6 Earth radii) and orbital period (8.3 days) are consistent with a Neptune-mass planet whose rocky core is enveloped by a primordial atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Finally, based on Gaia kinematics and TESS rotation periods, the open cluster NGC 2516 (≈150 Myr old) has a halo of stars that spans 500 parsecs tip-to-tip (Chapter 7). This supports a new Gaia-enabled paradigm wherein the halos of open clusters are often more populous than their cores. There are significant implications for upcoming planet searches around young stars.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aAstrophysics. 4aAstronomy. 4aPlanetology.  aPlanet evolution  aExoplanet diversity  aTidal inspirals  aHot Jupiters  aShort-period giant planets  aCluster Difference Imaging

Who gets to define and diagnose “risk?” Securing the Crisis examines overlapping transformations in North American racialization, language, and poetics that inform perceptions of risk in the wake of modern securitization. I argue that for brown and Black artists, a “poetics of risk” encourages untimeliness, dislocation, and conspiratorial opacity to refuse the hold of surveillance, deindustrialization, and fungibility. Each chapter, organized by critical catastrophic events of the early 21st century (September 11, Hurricane Katrina, the subprime mortgage crisis), interrogates how creative and cultural production engage in this poetics of risk, informed not only by race in the sociological sense, but by legal, economic, environmental, and affective considerations as well.Risk is the framework which organically enables this project to discuss Black, Indigenous, Middle Eastern, and Asiatic diasporic cultures relationally across material, affective, and theoretical conditions. Ultimately, this is a project concerned with the processes through which historical narratives become embedded within communities, and how racialized and minoritized subjects deploy epistemological abstraction and fragmentation not just as resistance, but to rework the conventions of periodicity, materialism, and reality that we accept as hegemonic. As such, this project asks: what is it that we mean when we use “risk,” whether it is to be at risk or to pose a risk? What, exactly, is being risked? Centering the experiences of those who live in the very matrices of this spectrum, each of these chapters is an attempt to begin new poetic archives curated for understanding these nodes of imperial accumulation and acceleration.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aEthnic studies. 4aAmerican studies. 4aAmerican literature. 4aComparative literature.  aCrisis  aCulture  aPoetics of risk  aRace  aRisk  aModern securitization  aHistorical narratives  a0631  a0323  a0591  a029520aPrinceton University.bEnglish.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871663203276nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002900131245007700160260005800237300001100295500007800306500004600384500002700430502004800457506006900505506005900574520174300633590002302376650002302399650001802422653001302440653001702453653001502470653001402485653001502499653001102514690000902525690000902534710004602543773005102589790000902640791001002649792000902659793001202668856015002680AAI2871722620220920004340.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487479  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28717226  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMartin, Nicholas Robert.14aThe Evolution and Regulation of Morphological Complexity in the Vibrios. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a123 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aIncludes supplementary digital materials.  aAdvisor: Gitai, Zemer.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aLike all life forms, bacteria come in many shapes and sizes that evolved in response to their evolutionary niches. Bacterial morphology is defined by a peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall and the cytoskeleton-guided PG synthesis machinery that builds rod shape cells is well-studied. In contrast, we lack an understanding of how more complex bacterial morphologies are built, how complex shape determinants may interact with the rod-determining machinery, and how complex morphologies can arise de novo. Here, we study the curved pandemic pathogen Vibrio cholerae as a model for cell shape complexity. We demonstrate that two proteins, CrvA and CrvB, are the only Vibrio-specific factors required for cell curvature by using them to artificially induce cell curvature in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Caulobacter crescentus, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Characterization of CrvA/B in V. cholerae, E. coli, and in vitro revealed that CrvA/B act as a modular unit that acts autonomously of the cytoskeleton-guided PG synthesis machinery by assembling periplasmic filaments that can bind directly to the cell wall to locally limit cell wall growth. Furthermore, we investigated the unique contributions of CrvA and CrvB to filament formation and curvature. This uncovered a potential evolutionary trajectory for the crv genes wherein crvA and crvB arose through partial duplication of an ancestral hybrid gene followed by specialization that promotes rapid changes in cell curvature. The modular, cytoskeleton-autonomous nature of CrvA/B demonstrates that bacterial morphology is more plastic than previously appreciated and suggests that cell shape complexity can arise without the coevolution of integral cell biological components.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMolecular biology. 4aMicrobiology.  aBacteria  aCell biology  aCell shape  aCurvature  aMorphology  aVibrio  a0307  a041020aPrinceton University.bMolecular Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871722603191nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001500131245007200146260005800218300001100276500007800287500002600365502004800391506006900439506005900508506006700567520171300634590002302347650001302370650001802383653000802401653001402409653001602423653002002439690000902459690000902468710005102477773005102528790000902579791001002588792000902598793001202607856015002619AAI2871751820220920004341.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487004  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28717518  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLi, Zequn.10aTowards Next-Generation Millimeter-Wave Cosmology from the Atacama. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a104 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Dunkley, Jo.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aWe expect both exciting new insights and analysis challenges from ground-based CMB surveys in the next decade, such as from the existing Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the South Pole Telescope (SPT), as well as from the upcoming Simons Observatory and CMB-S4.In this thesis, we demonstrate the utility of cross-correlating data from a large aperture instrument (ACT) with data from the Atacama B-mode Search (ABS), a small aperture instrument equipped with a half-wave plate, to target the polarization at large scales from the ground. This strategy is able to significantly suppress atmospheric contamination of the resulting power spectrum, and we expect to employ it in upcoming surveys. We then implement a complete Planck satellite analysis pipeline that reproduces both the intermediary and cosmological results of the PR3 data release. This effort is required for current and future joint analysis efforts of the Planck data with new, large-sky-fraction observations such as from ACT and Simons Observatory.We also present new simulated catalogs and maps of radio galaxies, which are consistent with the latest radio data (unlike pre-existing works). These radio sources present a challenge for a variety of cosmological analyses in the millimeter. These maps are also correlated with the large-scale structure through the Websky simulations. Finally, we provide new constraints on the interaction cross section between dark matter and baryons in the early Universe, by combining ACT DR4 data with Planck PR3. We show that the addition of small-scale data from ACT nearly halves the allowed parameter space of dark matter-baryon interaction models, compared to previous work using Planck alone.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPhysics. 4aAstrophysics.  aCMB  aCosmology  aDark matter  aInstrumentation  a0605  a059620aPrinceton University.bAstrophysical Sciences.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871751803774nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002600131245004700157260005800204300001100262500007800273500002900351502004800380506005900428520232100487590002302808650001902831653001702850653001902867653002302886653002402909653001102933653003702944653002402981653001703005690000903022690000903031690000903040710003803049773005103087790000903138791001003147792000903157793001203166856015003178AAI2871752420220920004341.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107915  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28717524  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLieberman, Carl Adam.10aEssays in Public Economics and Estimation. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a288 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Mas, Alexandre.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation has two main themes. The first is using the tools of public and labor economics to estimate how policies and other forces impact the lives of disadvantaged populations so that we may better understand and address both problems faced and their possible solutions. The second applies ideas from econometrics and applied microeconomics to improve how we interpret data. The intersection of these themes in research offers new perspectives and insights into some of society's most pressing problems.The first chapter studies racial disparities in police use of force, in particular how they vary. Despite efforts to address systemic racial inequities in the criminal justice system, in many areas, our understanding of the problems faced is poor. I combine novel data from the hundreds of independently operated police departments covering New Jersey with empirical Bayes techniques to estimate how racial disparities in police use of force vary across departments. I find significant variation but also note that these disparities are difficult to predict, suggesting a role for more idiosyncratic departmental features.The second chapter, co-authored with Christina Korting, Jordan Matsudaira, Zhuan Pei, and Yi Shen, examines the econometric role of graphs, focusing on regression discontinuity designs (RDDs). We experimentally evaluate people's abilities to conduct "visual inference" with graphs to determine the presence of discontinuities in RDDs. Moreover, we compare visual and econometric inferences' performances, highlighting the value of graph-based visual inference and the existence of complementarities between them. Visual inference compares favorably with conventional econometric procedures, and we believe that there is an untapped frontier of graph-based econometrics to be explored.The third chapter studies migratory responses to local minimum wages. Using the universe of tax filers in the US, I find that local minimum wages result in negatively selected out-migration from treated counties. Disemployment effects are one explanation, but I observe some pass-through to home values, and these may temper the positive effects of higher wages and earnings. There are no apparent spillovers to neighboring untreated areas, which may limit spatial distortions from these policies.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPublic policy.  aEconometrics  aMicroeconomics  aRacial disparities  aPolice use of force  aGraphs  aRegression discontinuity designs  aMigratory responses  aMinimum wage  a0501  a0510  a063020aPrinceton University.bEconomics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871752403957nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002300131245010000154260005800254300001100312500007800323500003200401502004800433506005900481520244300540590002302983650002703006650002903033650002003062653001403082653001003096653001403106653001803120653001803138653002303156690000903179690000903188690000903197710006403206773005103270790000903321791001003330792000903340793001203349856015003361AAI2871779620220920004341.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107984  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28717796  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aPalmer, Michael A.10aEvolution-Guided Investigation of Developmental Mechanisms in Lungs of Terrestrial Vertebrates. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a134 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Nelson, Celeste M.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe function of the lung is closely coupled to its structural anatomy, which varies greatly across vertebrates. As it develops, the avian lung transforms from an initially terminally branched epithelial tree to a continuous circuit of airways via a large-scale epithelial fusion event. We investigated airway fusion in the domestic chicken, Gallus gallus, and found that it is not stereotyped, instead occurring between airways that are stochastically located adjacent to each other. Prior to fusion, the fusing airways bend away from each other, then initiate new branches which contain the cells that form the first contact. These changes in epithelial shape coincide with the differentiation of smooth muscle cells that wrap the airways, suggesting a physical role for smooth muscle in shaping the pre-fusion epithelium. From the resulting nascent branches, individual epithelial cells extend cytoskeletal protrusions that form a bridge with their target airway. Additional cells then join the fusion site and build a bilayered epithelium between the two airways which is later cleared by apoptosis. In contrast to the complexity of the avian lung, the lizard lung consists of only a single hollow chamber with rudimentary corrugations along its surface. We examined early development of reptile lungs using the brown anole, Anolis sagrei, as a model organism and found that smooth muscle is present in a hexagonal mesh-like arrangement surrounding the epithelium. Using next-generation sequencing we discovered that smooth muscle differentiation is controlled by similar pathways as in the developing mouse lung, and that disrupting differentiation of smooth muscle prevents the formation of the shallow epithelial corrugations. Using timelapse imaging coupled with experiments designed to manipulate fluid pressure and muscle contractility, we revealed that the hexagonal smooth muscle geometry self-assembles in response to stresses downstream of mechanical forces, and that this is required for epithelial morphogenesis. We created a bio/synthetic model using these principles to deform a thin polymer film into a corrugated structure reminiscent of what is observed in vivo. Overall, these observations suggest a conserved evolutionary role for smooth muscle in mechanically shaping lung epithelia, albeit in patterns and final architectures that vary across classes of vertebrates, and present novel ideas for tissue engineering.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aDevelopmental biology. 4aEvolution & development. 4aBioengineering.  aEvolution  aLungs  aMechanics  aMorphogenesis  aSmooth muscle  aTissue engineering  a0758  a0412  a020220aPrinceton University.bChemical and Biological Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871779604538nam a2200433   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002200131245008200153260005800235300001100293500007800304500002800382502004800410506006900458506005900527520303900586590002303625650002303648650002803671653002103699653001403720653002003734653001603754653001503770653002303785690000903808690000903817710003703826773005103863790000903914791001003923792000903933793001203942856015003954AAI2871806620220920004341.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487226  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28718066  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aTavana, Daniel L.14aThe Origins of Opposition: Elections, Identity, and Order in the Middle East. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a247 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Jamal, Amaney.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aWhy do strong oppositions emerge in some autocracies, but not others? Foundational scholarship on electoral authoritarianism has shown that autocrats use elections to limit opposition through the cooptation of rivals, monitoring of citizens, and distribution of patronage. But in many cases across autocracies, oppositions succeed in these same elections. This dissertation presents and tests a theory that explains this variation through a detailed analysis of electoral politics in Kuwait. I advance a novel theory of endogenous opposition that focuses on the effect of repeated, strategic interactions between candidates and voters in elections. By analyzing the electoral districts in which these interactions take place, the dissertation uncovers the microfoundations of opposition success. Repeated elections in autocracies—often seen as a mechanism of authoritarian control—can lay the foundations of successful oppositional challenge. To explain variation in opposition strength, I argue that district-level social structure shapes the electoral strategies candidates pursue to win elections. Autocrats target candidates who can deliver the greatest number of votes in support of the regime, favoring large, dominant groups. In contrast, candidates representing minority groups must resort to "ideological accommodation," or the instrumental use of ideological labels and appeals to capture a larger number of out-group voters and compete effectively with candidates representing large, dominant groups. Once in the legislature, legislators who use these ideological appeals are more likely to oppose the autocrat. While many observers claim the persistence of autocracy in the Middle East renders undemocratic elections unlikely pathways for citizen-driven change, original data on electoral and legislator behavior from Kuwait suggests otherwise. The theory I propose bridges the disconnect between how scholars tend to think about elections, and how voters and candidates actually participate in them. Though nearly every autocrat takes measures to prevent such an outcome, many legislatures become sites of contention between regime allies and rival oppositional elites. Often, the exclusionary nature of these institutions sows the very seeds of opposition autocrats seek so desperately to prevent. These findings challenge existing conceptions of electoral and authoritarian politics. In diverse autocracies where identity is politically salient, meaningful opposition can emerge endogenously from repeated elections. Opposition arises not because incumbent autocrats need it, but because the patterning of groups across electoral districts encourages smaller groups to accommodate ideological alternatives. This argument suggests that unfair elections do not mechanically manifest the providence of dictators who hold them. Authoritarian elections may not always facilitate democratic representation, but this does not mean they are incapable of generating powerful challenges to the vagaries of authoritarian rule.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPolitical science. 4aMiddle Eastern studies.  aAuthoritarianism  aElections  aEthnic identity  aMiddle East  aOpposition  aPolitical behavior  a0615  a055520aPrinceton University.bPolitics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871806603465nam a2200469   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002000131245006500151260005800216300001100274500007800285500003200363502004800395506006900443506005900512520196100571590002302532650001502555650002202570650001902592653000802611653001102619653001102630653001202641653001402653653001302667690000902680690000902689690000902698690000902707710003802716773005102754790000902805791001002814792000902824793001202833856015002845AAI2871816520220920004342.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108455  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28718165  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aBialas, Ulrike.10aForever 17: The Contested Ages of Asylum Seekers in Germany. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a316 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Duneier, Mitchell.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aSince 2015, hundreds of thousands of young unaccompanied men from the Greater Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa have sought asylum in Germany without identifying documents. While some preferred not to disclose their identity, others actually did not own documents, particularly ones containing a date of birth. Because age does not have much cultural or legal importance in parts of the Global South, many of these young asylum seekers did not even know their exact date of birth. Germany, however, relies on a rigid distinction between minors and adults to determine eligibility for youth welfare, the applicability of asylum and residence laws, and the allocation of other crucial rights and resources. The German state has therefore faced the challenge of how to determine asylum seekers’ ages, while young asylum seekers themselves often believe that minority is their only chance for a safe and fulfilling life in Europe and therefore resort to the cumbersome process of establishing their minority and the infantilizing reality of living as a minor. Based on more than three years of ethnographic fieldwork with young, male asylum seekers in Berlin, as well as age examiners, social workers, and volunteers, this dissertation shows the negotiations between the German state and young unaccompanied asylum seekers over their age and the daily struggles of living with a contested identity. Not only are dates of birth ultimately impossible to determine, the conflict over migrants’ minority also reveals the true complexity and cultural contingencies of the only at first glance natural category age. Age may not be the best proxy for migrants’ vulnerability at all, as a binary distinction between minors and adults obscures the nuances of youth, impedes the healthy desires for independence and self-actualization of those scrambling to be classified as minors, and leaves those classified as young adults outside vital state support systems.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aSociology. 4aEuropean studies. 4aPublic policy.  aAge  aAsylum  aEurope  aGermany  aMigration  aRefugees  a0626  a0630  a0601  a044020aPrinceton University.bSociology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871816503501nam a2200469   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100003500131245011300166260005800279300001100337500007800348500007000426502004800496506006900544506005900613520183400672590002302506650002402529650001602553650003202569650001602601653001602617653001302633653003002646653001102676653002002687653002002707690000902727690000902736690000902745710003602754773005102790790000902841791001002850792000902860793001202869856015002881AAI2871824320220920004342.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487585  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28718243  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aThorpe, Katherine Julian Lind.10aProtean Figures: Personified Abstractions from Milton’s Allegory to Wordsworth’s Psychology of the Poet. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a291 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Stewart, Susan;Wolfson, Susan;Gee, Sophie;Schor, Esther.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aProtean Figures: Personified Abstractions from Milton’s Allegory to Wordsworth’s Psychology of the Poet argues for the powerful, surprising richness of personified abstractions in eighteenth-century poetry. Many critics, following William Wordsworth’s rejection of abstract personifications in his Preface to Lyrical Ballads (first in 1800 and more vehemently in 1802), have failed to see personified abstractions as the protean, unstable, rich, and complex figures that they were. One fertile origin point for the prevalence and vitality of personification in eighteenth-century poetry, I suggest, was Milton’s personification “Sin” in his epic Paradise Lost (1667); Milton makes Sin at once an allegorical personification but also a sympathetic character. Drawing on Milton, eighteenth-century poets such as Anne Finch, William Collins, and Thomas Gray used the trope as a powerful resource for communicating abstract concepts such as “Pity” or “Anger” not as fixed and universal, but as representing the poet’s interior thoughts and feelings. Amidst the broad cultural, scientific, social, and religious changes of the Enlightenment, including the rise of print culture, expanding literacy and authorship, and anonymous readership, these poets deployed personification as a powerful tool for staging and encouraging new kinds of readerly recognition and identifications. Despite his professed embarrassment at the trope, I contend that Wordsworth’s accounts of the poet’s psychology and his relationship to readers developed directly from this rich poetic tradition. Personification—especially of abstractions—deserves our serious reconsideration as a trope that often points to the powerful work of the imagination in crafting poems and to how readers identify with and respond to these efforts.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aEnglish literature. 4aLiterature. 4aBritish & Irish literature. 4aPsychology.  aAbstraction  aAllegory  aEighteenth-century poetry  aMilton  aPersonification  aRomantic poetry  a0593  a0401  a062120aPrinceton University.bEnglish.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871824303768nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002100131245004300152260005800195300001100253500007800264500003200342502004800374506005900422520242600481590002302907650002302930653002402953653002202977653002402999653001003023653001903033690000903052690000903061690000903070710003803079773005103117790000903168791001003177792000903187793001203196856015003208AAI2871828620220920004342.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107861  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28718286  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aWise, Alexander.10aStructural Change in a Global Economy. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a202 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Rogerson, Richard.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation comprises three chapters which consider the macroeconomic and political effects of exposure to international trade. Rodrik (2016) observes that, relative to early industrializers, later industrializers have tended to attain lower peak industry value added and employment shares, and have attained those peak shares at lower levels of development. In Chapter 1, I establish that these differences are primarily driven by differences in the size of the manufacturing sector. These facts are rationalized in an open economy with global productivity dynamics. In an open economy, global productivities are an important determinant of the structural composition of each economy. Relative to early industrializers, later industrializers begin to develop in a world with markedly different global productivities and widespread, ongoing economic growth abroad. Consequently, later industrializers develop facing different relative prices conditional upon the level of development. This leads them to attain lower peak manufacturing value added and employment shares at lower levels of development.In Chapter 2, I document that differences between early and late developers in the extent of industrialization are predominantly due to differences in the growth of the processed metals, machinery and equipment manufacturing industries. Production in these industries is heavily concentrated in a small number of countries which supply these goods to the world. In an open economy model of structural change with hierarchical industrialization, there is minimal growth in these industries in most countries, other than the early industrial nations, since later industrializers develop facing different relative prices, and with different comparative advantage conditional on the level of development.In Chapter 3, coauthored with Vivek Sampathkumar, we investigate the extent to which trade and China are more salient issues in political campaigns in places in the US with greater exposure to Chinese import competition. Trade exposure measures are constructed using gross trade flows and estimates of value added trade flows. We exploit variation across electoral units and across the media markets where television advertising is purchased, and find that trade exposure measures are related to the increased prevalence of advertisements that mention China and associated economic concerns, such as trade or jobs.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPolitical science.  aInternational trade  aIndustrialization  aPolitical campaigns  aChina  aTrade exposure  a0501  a0510  a061520aPrinceton University.bEconomics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871828603864nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002500131245008700156260005800243300001100301500007800312500004600390500002700436502004800463506006900511506005900580520235300639590002302992650002303015650000903038653002903047653002003076653002403096653002603120690000903146690000903155710003703164773005103201790000903252791001003261792000903271793001203280856015003292AAI2871841220220920004342.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487547  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28718412  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aSasso, James Nathan.10aParties to the Suit: Partisan Litigation and the Development of American Politics. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a795 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: A.  aIncludes supplementary digital materials.  aAdvisor: Frymer, Paul.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aAlthough scholars have investigated how partisan politics interacts with federal courts, they have paid less, if any, attention to the phenomenon of partisan litigation—when one political party (such as Republicans) files or participates in a lawsuit aimed at a policy or action associated with their opposing party (such as Democrats). This dissertation remedies that gap by defining the phenomenon and by examining the conditions under which it occurs.Partisans, for the purposes of this dissertation, are elected federal officials or members of the national Democratic or Republican party apparatus. And partisans can litigate in several ways by: (1) filing the lawsuit; (2) working with partisan proxies who file the lawsuits; or (3) filing amicus briefs or otherwise affecting a lawsuit from behind the scenes. Building upon the fields of American political development and judicial politics, the dissertation theorizes that partisan litigation occurs when multiple political orders layer upon one another. Specifically, partisan litigation cannot occur without partisan polarization and judicial politicization creating conditions to make federal courts attractive theaters for partisans to signal policy positions or win policy victories when the legislative branches no longer serve those purposes. Other political orders also affect the likelihood of partisan litigation, such as the growth of executive power and closely divided elections. As shown by an original dataset, partisan litigation has occurred since the founding, but it has become much more common in the modern era. Ultimately, the dissertation explains why, and it analyzes what it means for the American political system that litigation, rather than deliberation, has become one of partisans’ go-to political moves.Adopting and synthesizing the frameworks of past scholars of law and politics, the dissertation takes a novel perspective for analyzing the evolution of American politics. It uses information gleaned from the unique dataset to examine how the incentives of partisan litigants differ from that of other litigants, and how their presence in the courtroom can affect the development of American politics. Partisan litigation is, largely, both a symptom of constitutional dysfunction and a phenomenon that can worsen what ails the American political system.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPolitical science. 4aLaw.  aCongressional litigation  aJudicialization  aPartisan litigation  aPartisan polarization  a0615  a039820aPrinceton University.bPolitics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871841202461nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002200131245004200153260005800195300001100253500007800264500003100342502004800373506005900421520111100480590002301591650001701614650002901631653001701660653001801677653002901695653004001724690000901764690000901773710004001782773005101822790000901873791001001882792000901892793001201901856015001913AAI2871864020220920004343.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471107946  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28718640  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aO'Dorney, Evan M.10aReflection Theorems for Number Rings. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a369 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Bhargava, Manjul.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe Ohno-Nakagawa reflection theorem is an unexpectedly simple identity relating the number of GL2ℤ-classes of binary cubic forms (equivalently, cubic rings) of two different discriminants D, -27D; it generalizes cubic reciprocity and the Scholz reflection theorem. In this paper, we provide a framework for generalizing this theorem using a global and local step. The global step uses Fourier analysis on the adelic cohomology H1(\uD835\uDD38κ,M) of a finite Galois module, modeled after the celebrated Fourier analysis on \uD835\uDD38κ used in Tate's thesis. The local step is combinatorial, more elementary but much more mysterious. We establish reflection theorems for binary quadratic forms over number fields of class number 1, and for cubic and quartic rings over arbitrary number fields, as well as binary quartic forms over ℤ; the quartic results are conditional on some computational algebraic identities that are probabilistically true. Along the way, we find elegant new results on Igusa zeta functions of conics and the average value of a quadratic character over a box in a local field.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMathematics. 4aTheoretical mathematics.  aNumber rings  aNumber theory  aOhno-Nakagawa identities  aReflection theorems (number theory)  a0405  a064220aPrinceton University.bMathematics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871864003674nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002100131245007300152260005800225300001100283500007800294500003200372502004800404506005900452520225100511590002302762650002302785650002702808650002802835653001402863653002802877653002602905690000902931690000902940690000902949710006502958773005103023790000903074791001003083792000903093793001203102856015003114AAI2871869820220920004343.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108417  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28718698  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aChang, Wesley K.10aCharacterizing Chemo-Mechanical Behavior of Lithium Metal Batteries. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a249 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Steingart, Daniel.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aRechargeable lithium metal batteries are the subject of intense research both academically and industrially, given the improvements in cell-level energy density compared with conventional lithium-ion batteries. Much of the research effort has focused on stabilizing the lithium metal negative electrode through new electrolyte formulations and interphase modifications, along with high spatial resolution characterization with state-of-the-art microscopy and spectroscopy. However, until recently, the evolving dynamics of this system during operation have been less explored, primarily due to the difficulty of detecting changes in lithium metal in situ or in operando. This dissertation explores the complex chemical and mechanical behaviors (“chemo-mechanics”), how they are interrelated and how they evolve with electrochemical perturbation of lithium metal. We start with an exploration of primary lithium metal deposition and how substrate surface chemistry affects lithium nucleation and growth. This is followed by a study exploring the chemical and morphological transitions of lithium metal as a function of current density and charge passed, utilizing spatially resolved spectroscopic and microscopic characterization. To complement these studies with characterization of macroscopic heterogeneities, an operando acoustic technique is developed. First, practical applications of this technique for far-from-equilibrium conditions in lithium-ion batteries are introduced (e.g. detection of fast-charge induced lithium metal plating and cell gassing), establishing acoustics as a useful tool for quantifying and qualifying physical behavior beyond simple predictive capabilities. Acoustic transmission is then used, alongside other spectroscopic, microscopic, magnetic and electrochemical techniques, to characterize lithium metal cells in both a liquid electrolyte (lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate) and a solid electrolyte (lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide) and dissect the complex chemo-mechanical behaviors during cell operation. Finally, spatially resolved multi-modal capabilities are developed for acoustic transmission to image entire electrochemical cells in operando while retaining useful information of physical behavior.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMaterials science. 4aAerospace engineering. 4aMechanical engineering.  aAcoustics  aLithium metal batteries  aLithium-ion batteries  a0794  a0548  a053820aPrinceton University.bMechanical and Aerospace Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871869804343nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100003100131245007800162260005800240300001100298500007800309500003200387502004800419506005900467520293900526590002303465650001303488650002103501650002803522653002103550653002203571653002103593690000903614690000903623690000903632710005103641773005103692790000903743791001003752792000903762793001203771856015003783AAI2871871120220920004343.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108400  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28718711  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aVillegas Rosales, Kevin A.10aProbing Many-Body Liquids and Solids in Two-Dimensional Electron Systems. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a114 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Shayegan, Mansour.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis thesis covers many-body liquids and solids occurring in two-dimensional electron systems (2DESs) confined to GaAs and AlAs quantum wells subjected to a large perpendicular magnetic field and cooled to very low temperatures. In GaAs 2DESs, we systematically explored the fractional quantum Hall liquid energy gap. Then, the Wigner solid and fractional quantum Hall liquid competition was investigated in AlAs 2DESs. Also, the very low-disorder GaAs 2DESs allow us to probe the thermal melting of bubble phases, a type of Wigner solid.In the first part of this thesis we report a systematic experimental study that incorporates very high-quality 2DESs confined to GaAs quantum wells with fixed density and varying well widths. The results demonstrate a clear decrease of the fractional quantum Hall energy gap as the electron layer is made thicker and the short-range component of the Coulomb interaction is weakened. We also provide a quantitative comparison between the measured energy gaps and the available theoretical calculations that take into account the role of finite layer thickness and Landau level mixing. All the measured energy gaps fall below calculated values, but as the electron layer thickness increases, experiments and calculations are in better agreement. Accounting for the role of disorder in a phenomenological manner, we find better overall agreement between the measured and calculated energy gaps, although some puzzling discrepancies remain.Next, the fate of the ground state of a 2DES at very low Landau level filling factors (v) where interaction reigns supreme was explored. We report experimental data for a new 2DES where the electrons are confined to an AlAs quantum well. The exceptionally high quality of the samples and the large electron effective mass allow us to determine the liquid-solid phase diagram for the 2D electrons in a large range of filling factors near $\\simeq 1/3$ and $\\simeq 1/5$. The data and their comparison with an available theoretical phase diagram reveal the crucial role of Landau level mixing and finite electron layer thickness in determining the prevailing ground states.In the latter part of this thesis, we present the screening properties of bubble phases, probed via a simple capacitance technique where the 2DES is placed between a top and a bottom gate and the electric field penetrating through the 2DES is measured. The bubbles formed at very low temperatures screen the electric field poorly as they are pinned by the residual disorder potential, allowing a large electric field to reach the top gate. As the temperature is increased, the penetrating electric field decreases and, surprisingly, exhibits a pronounced minimum at a temperature that appears to coincide with the melting temperature of the bubble phase. We deduce a quantitative phase diagram for the transition from bubble to liquid phases for Landau level filling factors 4 ≤ v ≤ 5.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPhysics. 4aQuantum physics. 4aElectrical engineering.  aElectron systems  aMany-body liquids  aMany-body solids  a0605  a0599  a054420aPrinceton University.bElectrical Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871871104316nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002200131245004400153260005800197300001100255500007800266500003300344502004800377506005900425520282300484590002303307650002103330650002203351650002703373653002003400653002003420653000903440653004303449653003103492653001503523690000903538690000903547690000903556710006403565773005103629790000903680791001003689792000903699793001203708856015003720AAI2871900920220920004344.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108189  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28719009  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMagann, Alicia B.10aDesigning Quantum Controls Efficiently. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a229 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Rabitz, Herschel A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aOptimal control theory has played an important role in many areas of science and engineering including aerospace, manufacturing, and chemical processing. More recently, these concepts have been applied to quantum systems, with the aim of determining the optimal controls to achieve a desired target, which can range from the breakage of a specific chemical bond to the application of a quantum logic gate. Emerging applications of quantum optimal control often involve complex quantum systems. To date, capabilities for studying these control problems from a theoretical perspective have been limited by two factors: (1) the high cost of iterative control field optimization, and (2) the prohibitive cost of simulating many-body quantum dynamics from first principles, a problem which is plagued by the so-called {curse of dimensionality}. These two issues present a significant challenge to the development of new quantum experiments and technologies that would require precise, accurate control. The goal of this thesis is to explore methods for addressing them. A means for addressing the iterative control field identification problem (1) is explored through a tracking control approach for faster control field identification without the need for iteration. Studies are presented that utilize tracking control to design fields to control the orientation of rotating linear and symmetric top molecules in 2D and 3D. In all cases considered, it is shown that the resulting fields are free of singularities. Following this, the problem of chemical mixture characterization is considered. In this setting, a scalable, single-shot mixture characterization procedure based on tracking control principles is introduced, which enables the sequential suppression of the optical responses of the chemical species in the mixture, enhancing their distinguishability. The resultant optical response data can then be used to infer the concentrations of the mixture constituents. Numerical illustrations are presented involving systems of diatomic molecules in the gas phase. The complexity of the many-body quantum dynamics problem (2) is first explored through the substitution of first-principles models by the lower cost Time-Dependent Hartree approximation, in order to scalably model the controlled dynamics of interacting molecular rotors in the weak dipole-dipole coupling regime. Following this, it is studied how (1) could alternatively be addressed by offloading the classically-difficult task of quantum dynamics simulation to a quantum computer, where it could be performed in polynomial time. To this end, a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm is developed for the task of computing quantum optimal control fields, and numerical illustrations are presented involving vibrational, rotational, and biological systems.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aQuantum physics. 4aComputer science. 4aComputational physics.  aQuantum systems  aOptimal control  aCost  aIterative control field identification  aMany-body quantum dynamics  aComplexity  a0599  a0984  a021620aPrinceton University.bChemical and Biological Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871900903993nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100003200131245013700163260005800300300001100358500007800369500002300447502004800470506005900518520249400577590002303071650002603094650002003120653001903140653002103159653002003180653001103200653001903211653002103230690000903251690000903260710006103269773005103330790000903381791001003390792000903400793001203409856015003421AAI2871913720220920004344.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487240  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28719137  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aFrazer, Michelle Elizabeth.10aUsing an Idealized Climate Model to Elucidate Physical Mechanisms and Improve Model Representation of Extratropical Cloud Feedbacks. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a157 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Ming, Yi.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aDespite recent advances, the extratropical cloud feedback is at the heart of uncertainty and intermodel spread in climate sensitivity among comprehensive General Circulation Models (GCMs). Here, to shed light on the underlying mechanisms, we use an idealized GCM---the Held-Suarez dynamical core with the addition of passive water vapor and cloud tracers and full cloud microphysics---to cleanly decompose the effects of individual cloud processes.A set of process-level experiments are designed to elucidate the mechanisms of an increase in extratropical liquid water path (LWP) in mixed-phase clouds with warming: higher adiabatic cloud water content, weaker liquid-to-ice conversion through the Bergeron-Findeisen process, and faster melting of ice and snow to rain. Perturbed parameter experiments demonstrate a strong dependence of the LWP feedback on the climatological LWP and independence from the climatological susceptible ice and supercooled liquid fraction.To examine the broader physical controls of extratropical humidity and clouds, separate saturation adjustment and full cloud scheme controls are used to consider the strength of advection-condensation theory. It is found that sub-grid-scale relative humidity distribution assumed within the cloud macrophysics limits isentropic transport of tropical moisture to the polar troposphere. Also, within the model's explicit treatment of cloud microphysics, re-evaporation of hydrometeors moistens and increases clouds in the lower troposphere.To investigate the direct influence of dynamical changes on humidity and clouds, we explore the impacts of altered meridional temperature gradients. We show that predicted extratropical jet shifts with warming have little effect on shortwave cloud radiative effects because they mainly affect cloud fraction, not cloud thickness which is principally connected to absolute temperature change. Overall, the results substantiate the utility of such idealized models for elucidating cloud processes in a systematic manner and highlight key cloud processes to constrain.Additionally, a set of realistic experiments are designed in a comprehensive GCM to study geoengineering using stratospheric aerosols and compare efficacy and impacts of reflecting and absorbing aerosols (sulfate) versus only reflecting aerosols (calcite). We evaluate which regions are better or worse off with geoengineering in a 2xCO2 world in terms of various climate metrics and consider the policy implications.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aAtmospheric sciences. 4aClimate change.  aClimate change  aClimate modeling  aCloud feedbacks  aClouds  aGeoengineering  aIdealized models  a0725  a040420aPrinceton University.bAtmospheric and Oceanic Sciences.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871913703920nam a2200433   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002100131245003300152260005800185300001100243500007800254500004400332502004800376506006900424506005900493520245200552590002303004650002303027650001603050653002503066653001603091653001903107653001903126653002503145653002003170690000903190690000903199710003703208773005103245790000903296791001003305792000903315793001203324856015003336AAI2871930620220920004344.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108790  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28719306  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aChan, Shuk Ying.10aPostcolonial Global Justice. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a295 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Beitz, Charles R.;Stilz, Anna.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation develops a view of “postcolonial global justice” as grounded on an ideal of social equality. While many colonized peoples attained formal sovereignty in mid-to-late 20th century, deepening globalization has continued to draw charges of neocolonialism. Drawing on the political thought of Third World anticolonial thinkers, I investigate how structures of colonial injustice continue to manifest in global politics, and what principles of global justice they call for. While there is a longstanding tendency to read anticolonial thinkers as nationalists whose main concern was defending sovereignty for the nation-state, and/or as forerunners of postcolonial critique who eschewed talk of moral ideals, I shift our focus to a second strand of anticolonialism by engaging closely with key writings of Jawaharlal Nehru, Kwame Nkrumah, Amilcar Cabral, Frantz Fanon, and Aime Cesaire. I argue that an important set of themes within anticolonial thought can be theorized as a critique of relations of inequality, and decolonization understood as the construction of egalitarian global and domestic relations. This second strand of anticolonialism, which grounds what I call the egalitarian face of decolonization, pushes us to rethink decolonization as a project of global integration on terms of equality, and has radical implications for thinking about global justice today. Based on this egalitarian reconstruction of anticolonialism, I develop a philosophical account of postcolonial global justice as social equality.I bring this account to bear on three different aspects of contemporary global politics, and explore the distinctive reforms needed to dismantle global hierarchies. First, engaging with Nkrumah’s work on neocolonialism, I take up the question of economic decolonization by focusing on international investment. Second, I turn to the question of cultural decolonization by focusing on the global trade in cultural goods. Engaging with Aime Cesaire and Amilcar Cabral’s critiques of cultural imperialism, I argue that decolonizing cultural globalization can be understood as overcoming a global racial hierarchy inherited from colonial discourses of civilization. Finally, engaging with Nehru’s writings on global governance, I take up the question of political decolonization by focusing on (un)democratic decision-making within institutions that regulate interactions between agents at the global level.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPolitical science. 4aPhilosophy.  aAnticolonial thought  aColonialism  aDecolonization  aGlobal justice  aPostcolonial justice  aSocial equality  a0615  a042220aPrinceton University.bPolitics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871930603494nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001600131245009500147260005800242300001100300500007800311500002700389502004800416506005900464520197900523590002302502650002702525650001202552650002002564653002502584653001502609653002002624653002202644653002302666653002602689690000902715690000902724690000902733710006502742773005102807790000902858791001002867792000902877793001202886856015002898AAI2871937020220920004344.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487202  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28719370  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLiu, Zirui.10aDynamics and Statistics of Cellular Instability in Laminar and Turbulent Expanding Flames. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a144 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Law, Chung K.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation consists of a series of studies on the dynamics and statistics of the cellular instability in both laminar and turbulent expanding flames. First of all, local quantities including the flame-induced velocity, curvature and strain rates of the cellularly-unstable laminar expanding flames have been measured for the first time to our knowledge. The statistics of these quantities and their relations with the global flame propagation have been investigated. Then, the flow field induced by the cellularly-unstable laminar expanding flames has been further processed to address the hypothesis of self-turbulization. The flow field near the unstable flamefront exhibits turbulence-like characteristics, and a power-law scaling relation in the energy spectra of tangential velocities on the flamefront have been discovered. It is demonstrated theoretically that such scaling relation is caused by the fractal nature of the wrinkled flame surface. Next, in light of the knowledge of cellular instability in laminar expanding flames, the effects of cellular instability in turbulent expanding flames have been studied thereafter. A scaling analysis has been conducted to show the interaction between Darrieus-Landau instability and turbulence in different regimes of the turbulent flame regime diagram. The turbulent flame speeds have also been measured in these regimes to validate the scaling analysis. Furthermore, the effect of the diffusional-thermal instability has also been investigated experimentally. It is shown that Darrieus-Landau instability controls the flame acceleration, while diffusional-thermal instability affects the magnitude of the flame speed. Next, the local statistics of the turbulent cellularly-unstable expanding flames in the corrugated flamelet regime have been studied, and the interaction between cellular instability and turbulence are assessed based on the statistics of the strain rates, the curvature and the surface spectra.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aAerospace engineering. 4aEnergy. 4aThermodynamics.  aCellular instability  aCombustion  aExpanding flame  aFlame propagation  aSelf-turbulization  aTurbulent flame speed  a0538  a0791  a034820aPrinceton University.bMechanical and Aerospace Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871937003499nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100003200131245006700163260005800230300001100288500007800299500003200377502004800409506005900457520218600516590002302702650001302725653001502738653001102753653000902764653002202773690000902795690000902804690000902813710003802822773005102860790000902911791001002920792000902930793001202939856015002951AAI2871964420220920004344.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108158  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28719644  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aOstrowski, Christine Marie.10aInvestment and Saving: The Role of Firm and Household Factors. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a142 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Rogerson, Richard.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aIn this dissertation, I explore various topics in macroeconomic development and microeconomic development. Chapters 1 and 2 focus on firm R&D spending in the Chinese economy, while Chapter 3 investigates commitment savings devices in northern Ghana.In Chapter 1, I estimate misallocation in R&D spending across firms. An extensive literature has demonstrated that misallocation can cause large decreases in aggregate TFP. I extend this literature by considering the effect of distortions on the cost of R&D. I present a model in which firms choose R&D spending but face heterogeneous distortions that change the implicit cost of R&D. I discipline this model with firm-level data from China's Annual Survey of Industries, and I find evidence of significant distortions on R&D that reduce aggregate TFP by 10 percent. However, in a country with large output distortions, R&D distortions can mitigate the negative effect of output distortions.In Chapter 2, I compare the R&D efficiency of private and state-owned firms in China, as measured by the relationship between patent output and R&D input. I find that the efficiency of state-owned firms is significantly below that of private firms. However, when these results are disaggregated by industry, I find that the difference between state-owned and private firms is small for most sectors. Chapter 3 investigates the degree to which private information mediates the relationship between intra-household transfer requests and usage of commitment savings accounts. The World Bank Africa Gender Innovation Lab, in partnership with Ghana's North Volta Rural Bank, offered a new mobile-phone based savings product to married men and women in Ghana's Volta region. We randomly varied spousal information regarding whether a liquidity restriction on the account is binding. We find that in private, individuals who face transfer requests from the spouse are more likely to use an account with a liquidity restriction. However, when the spouse has information about the account, this is no longer the case. This is evidence that for those who face household pressure to transfer money, spousal information erodes the benefit of commitment.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aFinance.  aInvestment  aSaving  aFirm  aHousehold factors  a0501  a0511  a050820aPrinceton University.bEconomics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871964404100nam a2200457   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002900131245011900160260005800279300001100337500007800348500002800426502004800454506006900502506005900571520248700630590002303117650002303140650001303163650001703176653002003193653002703213653003403240653001603274653002903290653002003319690000903339690000903348690000903357710003503366773005103401790000903452791001003461792000903471793001203480856015003492AAI2871967020220920004345.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487219  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28719670  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aStewart, William Joseph.10aMathematik Ist Immer Geist: The Persistence of Mathematical Humanism and Aesthetic Rationality in Postwar Germany. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a414 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Fore, Devin A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation provides a cultural-historical account of the role played by mathematics within conversations about the human in Germany after the Second World War. It tracks how a broad mathematical consciousness sharpens and complicates notions like rationality, irrationality, quantifiability, and the infinite in ways decisive for a post-fascist Europe and a new understanding of the human being’s place in society. This is the story of a group of cultural producers—philosophical polymaths, architects, industrial designers, poets, and visual artists— who embraced the belief that the mathematician would function as “analog” to the future humanist. The protagonists of this narrative needed no convincing of the high stakes of this wager: inheritors of the Nazi catastrophe and the horrors of the Holocaust as much as witnesses to the birth of globalisms nuclear and neoliberal, these figures know all too well the barbarisms that await those subject to uncritical calculative regimes.Rather than extolling the instrumentalization of quantification or numerically precise calculations, the dissertation’s case studies are concerned instead with the critically self- reflexive, rationally pluralist, and radically contingent character of mathematical thought. Over the course of three chapters that examine, respectively, the philosopher of technology Max Bense (1910–1990), the design pedagogy at the Hochschule fur Gestaltung Ulm (1953–1968), and the visual artist Hanne Darboven (1941–2009), this project reveals the way that the disciplinary crises and epistemological paradoxes that define theoretical mathematics in the century preceding World War II serve as a source of inspiration for postwar cultural actors plotting a new course that would defend against future fascism while taking seriously the place of mathematically technical rationality within the lived world. For the subjects of this dissertation, a mathematical consciousness grounds a politics of intelligence in an environment defined by technology; a method of intuitive design intended to educate citizens about the systems of consumption in which they live; and an approach to art-making that is as self-reflexive as it is self-generative. This study analyzes the legacy of mathematical thought in a diverse, interdisciplinary community of postwar humanists and considers how these cases might model productive yet critical positions within our own algorithmically saturated moment.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aGerman literature. 4aHistory. 4aArt history.  aDarboven, Hanne  aHistory of mathematics  aHochschule fur Gestaltung Ulm  aBense, Max   aPhilosophy of technology  aPostwar Germany  a0311  a0578  a037720aPrinceton University.bGerman.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871967003637nam a2200469   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002600131245009800157260005800255300001100313500007800324500004800402502004800450506006900498506005900567506006700626520200600693590002302699650002302722650002102745650002302766653001302789653001002802653001402812653001102826653001002837653001702847690000902864690000902873690000902882710003502891773005102926790000902977791001002986792000902996793001203005856015003017AAI2871996020220920004345.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108325  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28719960  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aKlinger, Sebastian P.10aHow to Do Sleep with Words: Sleep Experiments in Literature, Science, and Society, 1899-1929. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a267 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Jennings, Michael W.;Vogl, Joseph.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aHow to Do Sleep with Words: Sleep Experiments in Literature, Science, and Society, 1899– 1929 connects literary studies to the history of science. It explores the representation of sleep across natural scientific inquiry and both German and French literary discourse to answer three questions: What kind of activity is sleep? How to represent sleep? Who sleeps? How to Do Sleep with Words spearheads interdisciplinary research on its topic. Existing scholarship has focused on either the history of sleep science (Kroker 2007, Ahlheim 2018) or on sleep in literary writing (Greaney 2018, Kocziszky 2019), but we miss a scholarly work that weaves both strands together and investigates the consequences of this joint perspective. How to Do Sleep with Words is the first study that brings the experimental and the experiential dimensions of sleep into conversation. This allows the dissertation to show definitively that the rise of new medically and pharmaceutically produced forms of subjectivity brought forth the development of novel ways of capturing consciousness and the self in Modernist literature. This story still matters considering the present 24/7 society with its blurring of work and rest, its recalibration of human biorhythms, and its proliferation of insomnia.The significance of this research is threefold: first, How to Do Sleep with Words furthers the trend of grounding literature in cultural history, demonstrating a co-constitutive entanglement of literary and natural scientific modes of representation. Secondly, it adds new perspectives to the cultural history of modern subjectivity. Thirdly and finally, the dissertation revises standard explanations of Modernist literary techniques such as the interior monologue by linking their development to an overlooked context. All in all, How to Do Sleep with Words contributes to the growing movement of interdisciplinary humanistic research that offers fresh insights into fundamental anthropological categories such as sleep.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aGerman literature. 4aScience history. 4aFrench literature.  aInsomnia  aKafka  aModernism  aProust  aSleep  aSubjectivity  a0311  a0585  a020520aPrinceton University.bGerman.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2871996003525nam a2200469   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002900131245006400160260005800224300001100282500007800293500004400371502004800415506006900463506005900532506006700591520187000658590002302528650002802551650002802579650001102607653002102618653001302639653001202652653001902664653001202683653001802695690000902713690000902722690000902731710007402740773005102814790000902865791001002874792000902884793001202893856015002905AAI2872020820220920004346.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108943  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28720208  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aHankin, Charlie Diamond.10aBreak and Flow: Hip-Hop Poetics in Brazil, Cuba, and Haiti. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a377 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Price, Rachel;Carvalho, Bruno.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  a“Break and Flow: Hip-Hop Poetics in Brazil, Cuba, and Haiti” introduces an archive I have built of hundreds of rap songs to analyze hip-hop as a source for unprecedented “information trafficking,” as Brazilian rappers put it. Ubiquitous in Global South cities, hip-hop has received recent scholarly attention as an expression of the African diaspora. Few studies, however, explore its implications as a community writing project. Drawing on two years total of ethnographic fieldwork, formal analysis, and critical theory, I argue that hip-hop functions as a resource for performing transnational poetic citizenship around colonial legacies of place, writing, and time. Part one, “World Hip-Hop: Uprooting and Marginality,” treats rap as a history- and place-making project. I argue that the decolonial histories that circulate about and through hip-hop point to cosmopolitan notions of urban marginality that eschew resurgent nationalisms. Part two, “Writing: Literacy and Violence,” analyzes how artists establish new poetic genealogies and redefine rap as a writing project. Engaging with scholarship on the politics of literacy, I demonstrate the way rap disavows the colonial violence of letters and urbanization. Part three, “Deixis: Raplove and Yearning,” considers rap’s political implications. First, I explore antecedents in Afro-Caribbean poetic and religious practices and European ars poetica for the recursive gesture I call raplove (rapping about rap). Finally, I turn to black feminist and market yearnings—for better worlds and material earnings. At the intersection of sound studies and Afro-diasporic poetics, “Break and Flow” aims to shed light on how knowledge is produced and distributed in the Global South by means of new media to refine our understanding of poetry and popular music at the turn of the millennium.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aComparative literature. 4aLatin American studies. 4aMusic.  aAfrican diaspora  aAurality  aHip-hop  aIntermediality  aPoetics  aSound studies  a0295  a0550  a041320aPrinceton University.bSpanish and Portuguese Languages and Cultures.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872020802827nam a2200457   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002200131245007100153260005800224300001100282500007800293500004000371502004800411506006900459506005900528520129400587590002301881650001501904650002201919650001901941653001001960653002501970653001901995653001602014653001602030653001702046690000902063690000902072690000902081710003802090773005102128790000902179791001002188792000902198793001202207856015002219AAI2872021120220920004346.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487561  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28720211  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMoskowitz, Scott.10aState, Street, Store: The Development of the Chinese Middle Class. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a342 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Fernandez-Kelly, Patricia.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation considers the emergence of the Chinese middle class as a sociological phenomenon. Though much discussed in the media, both in China and abroad, the Chinese middle class has received limited attention in sociological literature, owing partly to inherent difficulties in separating out subjective, popular understandings of middle classness from what are considered to be more objective empirical measures. This dissertation argues that such distinctions are inherently flawed because of the way popular and subjective narratives of class inform identity and, in turn, shape social action, social structure, and social reality. Relying on ethnographic fieldwork conducted at a number of sites in China across numerous years, this dissertation utilizes a Weberian verstehen approach to analysis in an attempt to articulate a realistic model of identity formation and class emergence that interrogates and holistically integrates subjective influences like State discourse and popular understanding with empirical evidence. As such, special attention is paid to the discursive legacies of Marxism and the confusing—and empirically relevant—contradictions these engender in a resurgent China deeply committed to ideals of State development and Western-looking consumerism.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aSociology. 4aSocial structure. 4aAsian studies.  aChina  aChinese middle class  aClass analysis  aDevelopment  aEthnography  aMiddle class  a0626  a0700  a034220aPrinceton University.bSociology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872021102544nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001700131245005600148260005800204300001100262500007800273500003000351502004800381506005900429520121100488590002301699650001301722650002501735650002101760653001501781653001401796653002001810690000901830690000901839690000901848710003601857773005101893790000901944791001001953792000901963793001201972856015001984AAI2872035520220920004346.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108974  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28720355  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLam, Ho Tat.10aOn Symmetries, Anomalies and Their Generalizations. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a253 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Seiberg, Nathan.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation explores various generalizations of global symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies.

It focuses on exotic theories with subsystem symmetries including theories of fractons. We reformulate these theories on a Euclidean spacetime lattice in a modified Villain formulation. This provides a rigorous treatment of the continuum theories and their singularities while preserving some of their essential properties including 't Hooft anomalies and dualities. Chapter four is based on work with Clay Cordova, Dan Freed and Nathan Seiberg [3, 4]. It extends the notion of 't Hooft anomalies to anomalies in the space of coupling constants. We demonstrate through examples in diverse dimensions that these generalized anomalies can constrain the phase diagram of the theories and their defects associated with space-dependent coupling constants.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPhysics. 4aTheoretical physics. 4aApplied physics.  aSymmetries  aAnomalies  aGeneralizations  a0605  a0753  a021520aPrinceton University.bPhysics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872035503429nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002100131245009500152260005800247300001100305500007800316500002500394502004800419506005900467520203300526590002302559650001802582650001502600653001502615653001802630653002102648653001202669653002802681690000902709690000902718710005102727773005102778790000902829791001002838792000902848793001202857856015002869AAI2872051220220920004346.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108639  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28720512  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aBailey, Avery P.10aModels of Planetary Envelopes for an Increasingly Hydrodynamic Theory of Planet Formation. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a152 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Stone, Jim.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aCore accretion, the process by which gas giants are generally thought to form, has been formulated as the quasi-static contraction of a gaseous envelope regulated by radiative cooling. In reality, the process can be far more dynamic with circumplanetary flows transporting mass and energy. The discovery of diverse exoplanet systems along with advances in computing power have prompted a re-examination of core accretion and the quasi-static assumption in particular. To this end, we investigate hydrodynamic extensions to core accretion with 3-dimensional fluid simulations of the envelopes around planetary cores. We first relax the assumption of a circular orbit and study changes to the flow field around embedded planets when subject to a small but non-zero eccentricity. We find a dramatic alteration of the flow geometry and an enhanced flux of gas being recycling through the planetary envelope. These increased fluxes may increase the pebble accretion rate for eccentric planets up to several times that of the circular orbit rate. While the rotational state of circumplanetary disks in these models remain unchanged, gas exterior to the disk can exhibit enhanced rotation or even retrograde motion in extreme cases. Because envelope growth is regulated by radiative cooling, we also present the results of a series of circular orbit hydrodynamic simulations utilizing an improved method of radiative transfer. These envelope models span a range of cooling times and opacities, making them applicable to both super-Earths and early stages of giant formation. We present calculated mass accretion rates along with details of envelope structure, finding them to be distinct from both adiabatic and isothermal models. We interpret the resultant scalings, judge the fidelity of other methods, and discuss the implications of our radiation-hydrodynamic models in the context of planet formation. We end with future applications and potential improvements to our 3D models that would enable further comparison with 1D models.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aAstrophysics. 4aAstronomy.  aExoplanets  aHydrodynamics  aPlanet formation  aPlanets  aRadiation-hydrodynamics  a0596  a060620aPrinceton University.bAstrophysical Sciences.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872051203496nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100003300131245010300164260005800267300001100325500007800336500004400414502004800458506006900506506005900575520203600634590002302670650001602693653001402709653001402723653000902737653001202746653002302758653001602781690000902797710003902806773005102845790000902896791001002905792000902915793001202924856015002936AAI2872072820220920004347.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487578  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28720728  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aNaranjo Sandoval, Alejandro.10aOn the Relation Between Kant, Leibniz, and the Leibnizians: Intuition, Sensibility, and Cognition. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a160 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Hogan, Desmond;Garber, Daniel.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aKant holds that two faculties are required for Erkenntnis – that is, an important epistemic state, sometimes translated as ‘knowledge’ or ‘cognition:’ the understanding and sensibility. Accordingly, he criticizes Leibniz for denying this and holding instead that there is a single cognitive faculty (i.e., “faculty monism”). These essays concern the role of sensibility and intuitions in Kant’s theory of cognition, as well as his criticism of Leibniz’s faculty monism.In Chapter 1, I provide an account of faculty monism in Leibniz and the Leibnizians Wolff and Baumgarten. I argue that Leibniz provided a framework and terminology which was developed much more fully by Wolff and Baumgarten. In their work, faculty monism became a serious research program, with its own distinctive commitments, predictions, and challenges.In Chapter 2, I reconstruct three fundamental notions in Kant’s philosophy of mind: representation, consciousness, and cognition. Commentators often hold that cognitions are transparent to the cognitive subject. I argue that this is not the case. These notions are instead continuous with the usage of Leibnizian philosophers. An important upshot: since intuitions and concepts are said to be cognitions, both encode information about objects. In Chapter 3, I provide a novel account of the nature of intuitions based on two claims: First, unlike concepts, intuitions depict their objects, that is, there is an isomorphism between the representable features of the object and the intrinsic features of intuitions as vehicles. Second, intuitions are thoroughgoingly determined representations: they represent all the representable features of their objects. This suggests the historical claim that Kant was influenced by Leibnizian debates about the nature of singularity in his theorizing about intuitions. The takeaway is that Kant’s faculty dualism is an innovation and improvement over Leibniz’s monism: the former alone allows for cognition of singular objects, and hence truth.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPhilosophy.  aCognition  aIntuition  aKant  aLeibniz  aPhilosophy of mind  aSensibility  a042220aPrinceton University.bPhilosophy.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872072803793nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002100131245006300152260005800215300001100273500007800284500002700362502004800389506005900437520234800496590002302844650002302867650002902890650001602919653002102935653001902956653002102975653000902996653000803005653001503013690000903028690000903037690000903046710005103055773005103106790000903157791001003166792000903176793001203185856015003197AAI2872074920220920004347.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108707  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28720749  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aTarr, Alexander.10aMachine Learning Methods for Computational Social Science. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a188 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Imai, Kosuke.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aContributing to the rising popularity of computational social science, this dissertation presents new methods grounded in machine learning for solving several important problems in political science.In Chapter 2, adapted from coauthored work in Fifield et al. (2020), we present a new algorithm for sampling redistricting plans from arbitrary distributions. We formulate redistricting as a graph-cut problem and adapt an image segmentation algorithm from the computer vision literature to construct a Metropolis-Hastings style algorithm for sampling graph partitions. We then validate our algorithm using a small-scale map for which all possible redistricting plans can be enumerated, finding that our method samples from the true distribution. Lastly, we apply our algorithm to a more realistic redistricting problem using data from New Hampshire.In Chapter 3, adapted from coauthored work with June Hwang and Kosuke Imai, we develop a fully-automated video processing system for encoding information in political campaign advertisement videos. Our approach applies state-of-the-art algorithms to replicate a subset of variables in the human-labeled Wesleyan Media Project (WMP) data, performing tasks including video summarization, facial recognition, text recognition, speech recognition, audio classification, and text classification. We validate our method using the WMP data from the 2012 and 2014 election cycles, finding that machine coding is competitive with human coding for most of the variables considered in our study.In Chapter 4, adapted from coauthored work in Tarr and Imai (2021), we adapt the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to address the balancing problem in causal inference. We first establish SVM as a kernel balancing method by showing that the soft-margin SVM dual problem computes weights which balance functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We then show that the SVM cost parameter controls a trade-off between balance and sample size, allowing us to use path algorithms to give exact characterizations of how balance and causal effect estimates change over the path. We validate our method using simulation data, showing that our algorithm is competitive with leading balancing methods. Finally, we conduct an empirical study using the right heart catheterization data from Connors et al. (1996).  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPolitical science. 4aArtificial intelligence. 4aStatistics.  aCausal inference  aGerrymandering  aMachine learning  aMCMC  aSVM  aVideo data  a0615  a0800  a046320aPrinceton University.bElectrical Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872074903721nam a2200361   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002700131245005500158260005800213300001100271500007800282500002700360502004800387506005900435520245800494590002302952650002202975653003002997653001903027653001803046690000903064710004503073773005103118790000903169791001003178792000903188793001203197856015003209AAI2872079720220920004347.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108868  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28720797  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aNgo, Quang Minh Khiem.10aTolerating Slowdowns in Replicated State Machines. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a146 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Lloyd, Wyatt.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aReplicated state machines (RSMs) are linearizable, fault-tolerant groups of replicas that are coordinated using a consensus algorithm. RSMs are used throughout large-scale systems, such as distributed databases, cloud storage, and service managers. At such scale, it is common for some machines to be slow. In this dissertation, we address the problem of developing slowdown-tolerant RSMs that continue to operate as fast RSMs despite the presence of slow replicas. We define s-slowdown-tolerance and identify why existing consensus protocols are not slowdown-tolerant. As the first and pragmatic step toward slowdown-tolerant RSMs, we design, implement, and evaluate two 1-slowdown-tolerant consensus protocols, Copilot and Latent Copilot.Copilot replication is the first 1-slowdown-tolerant consensus protocol: it delivers normal latency despite the slowdown of any 1 replica. Copilot uses two distinguished replicas—the pilot and copilot—to proactively add redundancy to all stages of processing a client’s command. Copilot uses dependencies and deduplication to resolve potentially differing orderings proposed by the pilots. To avoid dependencies leading to either pilot being able to slow down the group, Copilot uses fast takeovers that allow a fast pilot to complete the ongoing work of a slow pilot. Copilot includes two optimizations—pingpong batching and null dependency elimination—that improve its performance when there are 0 and 1 slow pilots respectively. Our evaluation of Copilot shows its performance is lower but competitive with Multi-Paxos and EPaxos when no replicas are slow. When a replica is slow, Copilot is the only protocol that avoids high latencies.Latent Copilot, a variant of Copilot, is another design and implementation of a 1-slowdown-tolerant consensus protocol. Latent Copilot operates with one active pilot, which actively proposes commands, and one latent pilot, which proposes commands only when necessary. In this way, Latent Copilot achieves an intermediate tradeoff between Multi-Paxos and Copilot in terms of throughput and slowdown tolerance. Our evaluation of Latent Copilot shows that it achieves 1-slowdown tolerance and that its performance with no slowdowns is comparable to Multi-Paxos.Finally, we generalize the design of Copilot replication to handle more than one slowdown. We provide the design of an s-slowdown-tolerant protocol that achieves slowdown tolerance despite s slow replicas.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aComputer science.  aReplicated state machines  aLatent copilot  aDeduplication  a098420aPrinceton University.bComputer Science.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872079703328nam a2200373   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001900131245009900150260005800249300001100307500007800318500002700396502004800423506005900471520199000530590002302520650003002543653001602573653002202589653002702611653003002638690000902668710003602677773005102713790000902764791001002773792000902783793001202792856015002804AAI2872092520220920004347.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487066  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28720925  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aOh, Seong Woo.10aCryogen-Free Scanning Probe Microscopy in Silicon Device Physics at Milli-Kelvin Temperatures. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a115 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Petta, Jason.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aSpin qubits housed in silicon quantum dots are rapidly emerging as a viable quantum computing platform. In recent years, there have been single- and two-qubit gate demonstrations, which showed high fidelities to the extent that implementing quantum error correction codes appears to be within reach. With the already existing industrial manufacturing infrastructure, semiconductor spin qubits are well poised to bring us ever closer to making quantum computing in everyday application a reality.There do stand a few technical obstacles in the way, however. One prominent issue has been the splitting of the two lowest lying valley states in the silicon band structure. The valley states, when their energy is comparable to the Zeeman splitting, have shown to often lead to spin-relaxation hotspots, which significantly increases the spin relaxation rate. In addition, the valley splittings have shown to vary greatly not only among different wafers but also at different locations across the same wafer. Having a scanning gate microscope to provide spatially resolved data could be key to tackling this problem.In this thesis, we report our progress toward building a scanning gate system probing silicon quantum devices. We have built and operated a custom scanning probe microscope to show that the biasing of the tip of the scanning probe could play the role of a plunger gate even on devices with overlapping gate structure. Given the scanning probe sensor being a quartz crystal tuning fork and the richness of the physics one could probe with a superconducting resonator, we have fabricated and characterized microwave resonators on a quartz crystal to show the microwave resonators can potentially be housed on the resonator to directly port all our existing microwave measurement techniques. We have also etched a quartz crystal in the shape of a tuning fork to show the feasibility of designing and fabricating a custom tuning fork for future microwave impedance measurements.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aCondensed matter physics.  aSpin qubits  aQuantum computing  aSilicon band structure  aSuperconducting resonator  a061120aPrinceton University.bPhysics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872092503797nam a2200373   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002500131245008400156260005800240300001100298500007800309500003200387502004800419506006900467506005900536520244300595590002303038650002303061650001603084653001803100690000903118690000903127710004603136773005103182790000903233791001003242792000903252793001203261856015003273AAI2872098520220920004348.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487295  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28720985  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLefebvre, Matthew F.10aDynamic Analysis of Non-muscle Myosin II Recruitment during Germband Extension. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a194 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Wieschaus, Eric F.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aHow the combined action of genetic patterning and self-organized mechanical feedback leads to the robust construction of biological form is a fundamental question.  Here we present a dynamic, global analysis of anisotropic Non-Muscle Myosin II (MyoII) during Drosophila germband extension (GBE), with particular interest in elucidating the identity of the source responsible for MyoII recruitment.  Previously we demonstrated that over 90 percent of tissue flow during GBE can be predicted from dynamic MyoII expression.  However, the identity of the source responsible for anisotropic MyoII recruitment remains unclear.  Two distinct possibilities have been proposed.  Neighboring cells could sense and respond to juxtaposition of pair rule gene (PRG) expression across their shared interface, with the local gradient of PRG expression defining an instructive cue for orienting MyoII recruitment.  Alternatively, MyoII recruitment may be mechanosensitive.   To understand the relationship between PRGs and MyoII recruitment, we generated a global, dynamic atlas of PRG expression. We find that a cumulative description of PRG expression fails to predict the profile of anisotropic MyoII intensity.  Additionally, the relative angle between the orientation of MyoII and Runt stripes becomes progressively misaligned during the course of GBE.  Dynamic Runt expression is predictably Lagrangian, deforming with the tissue in response to flow.  In contrast, anisotropic MyoII orientation remains aligned with the DV axis except in close proximity to the region of the germband where the magnitude of flow field vorticity is highest.  FRAP analysis demonstrates that junctional MyoII has a finite lifetime and is fully mobile.  Using a simple linear regression model, nearly the entire regional misalignment that occurs between MyoII orientation and the DV axis where vorticity is strongest can be accounted for using a single, constant parameter—the ‘effective lifetime’—of MyoII.  This parameter reflects the average lifetime of MyoII association with the junctional F-actin cytoskeleton and is temporally consistent with the FRAP-derived experimental estimate of finite lifetime.  Together these results suggest that junctional MyoII recruitment is instructed by a static Eulerian source aligned with the DV axis that is independent of PRG expression.  We predict that the identity of this static source may be mechanical feedback.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMolecular biology. 4aBiophysics.  aMorphogenesis  a0307  a078620aPrinceton University.bMolecular Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872098503424nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001600131245009600147260005800243300001100301500007800312500004900390502004800439506006900487506005900556520185800615590002302473650002802496650002302524650002302547653001402570653002602584653002202610653001402632653001302646690000902659690000902668690000902677710005102686773005102737790000902788791001002797792000902807793001202816856015002828AAI2872110620220920004348.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487677  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721106  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aFan, Jiani.10aPleasure as a First Principle?

My two principal claims are that psychological examination is the most important philosophical method and the basic structure of life experience for Nietzsche, and that his hermeneutics of suspicion is grounded in psychological examination drawn from the French moralists. Their method of interpretation unmasked false consciousness and self-interested intention, and further detected disguised pleasure in the heroic virtues of honesty and Christian morality. For La Rochefoucauld and Pascal, the notion that magnanimity and other Stoic virtues were motivated by pleasure and by other postlapsarian self-interests served to persuade members of a worldly society to pursue Christian beatitude. Nietzsche, inspired more in this area by Montaigne, denies any other-worldly comfort. He advocates amor fati (love of fate) and this-worldly cheerfulness (Heiterkeit) and urges readers to pluck useful maxims from the thorniest stretches of their lives to alleviate the burden of living. Cheerfulness thus functions as an antidote for Nietzsche against the moralists’ austere search for other-worldly consolation. I focus on the notions and aphorisms related to symptoms, methods of therapy and remedies in the psychological observation. In investigating classical notions such as pleasure, Virgil’s belief that “everyone is driven by his pleasure,” the punning but crucial variant on Horace’s “saying something true with laughter,” as well as Heiterkeit (cheerfulness) and “mask” and “self-deception” in the dialogues among these authors. In sum, through these themes, I probe the concept of pleasure in the genealogy of (im)morality and (a)theism among the French moralists and Nietzsche.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aComparative literature. 4aFrench literature. 4aGerman literature.  aPleasure   aNietzsche, Friedrich   aFrench moralists   aMorality   aReligion  a0295  a0205  a031120aPrinceton University.bComparative Literature.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872110603913nam a2200457   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100003100131245012200162260005800284300001100342500007800353500004600431502004800477506006900525506005900594520226000653590002302913650002202936650000902958650002102967653003902988653002703027653002003054653001803074653002203092653003703114690000903151690000903160690000903169710003603178773005103214790000903265791001003274792000903284793001203293856015003305AAI2872114020220920004348.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108592  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721140  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aSchmidt, Katharina Isabel.10a"The Law that We Feel Living Within Us": German Jurists and the Search for "Life" in Modern Legal Science, 1900-1946. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a375 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Hartog, Hendrik;Gordin, Michael.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  a“The Law That We Feel Living Within Us” challenges established narratives of continuity and rupture in modern German legal history. Postwar scholars claimed that Germany’s long-standing tradition of legal positivism, based on the maxim “law is law,” had left jurists susceptible to Hitler. Subsequent scholars, by contrast, analyzed the Third Reich in terms of “bionomy,” a novel kind of race-jurisprudence based on the maxim “life is law.” Charting a middle ground between these views, my dissertation demonstrates that German law was life-law long before the Nazis came to power. Life, leading up to the Third Reich, had implied not so much race as flexibility of method, structure, and procedure. Though life continued to have that meaning past 1933, the Nazis added an extra dimension: blood. Legal vitalism, for Wilhelmine and Weimar jurists, had been compatible with legal science. Hitler’s governing elites, however, tried to gradually eradicate the discipline and its practitioners. Nothing, and no one, could come between the German people and the law they felt in their hearts.My dissertation explores changing meanings of life in law through the medium of life as biography. Based on published and unpublished sources from three continents, I tell the story of a cohort of German jurists, born between 1877 and 1878, who were central members of the so-called free law movement: Gustav Radbruch, Hermann Kantorowicz, Max Rumpf, Theodor Sternberg, and Justus Wilhelm Hedemann. Drawing on the life sciences, life philosophy, and life reform, all five criticized conventional legality for being abstract, unworldly, and out of touch with life. Through scholarship and social activism, they popularized the idea that law was not what the Code said it was but what reality demanded. Their maxim “life is law” transformed German jurisprudence from the bottom up—so much so that it still captivated Nazi jurists a generation later. By 1933, some free lawyers were living as exiles in Japan and the U.S., while others were working their way up the Nazi career ladder. My dissertation traces how all five of my protagonists reckoned with uncomfortable parallels between their youthful free law ideas and Nazi life-jurisprudence.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aEuropean history. 4aLaw. 4aScience history.  aFree law movement; free law school  aLaw in the third reich  aLegal modernism  aLegal realism  aLife-law; bionomy  aNazi law; national socialist law  a0335  a0398  a058520aPrinceton University.bHistory.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872114003450nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001300131245013000144260005800274300001100332500007800343500003400421502004800455506006900503506005900572520196000631590002302591650001802614650002302632650001602655653001702671653001202688653001402700690000902714690000902723690000902732710004602741773005102787790000902838791001002847792000902857793001202866856015002878AAI2872128520220920004348.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108554  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721285  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aDu, Jin.10aStructure and Mechanism of Nocturnin and NADK2: The Discovery of a Molecular Link Between the Circadian Clock and Metabolism. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a109 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Korennykh, Alexei V.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aNicotinamide dinucleotides NADP(H) and NAD(H) are central cofactors driving metabolic reactions in all forms of life. The cellular roles of both NADP(H) and NAD(H) are remarkably well-understood. Nevertheless, here I describe the discovery that the circadian protein, Nocturnin (NOCT), belongs to a new enzyme class, which converts NADP(H) into NAD(H) inside mitochondria. I also describe the use of X-ray crystallography, biochemistry, metabolomics and cell biology to decipher mechanisms of NOCT and its partner kinase, NAD kinase 2 (NADK2).The first part of my thesis work focused on NOCT, which is a rhythmically expressed protein that regulates metabolism under the control of circadian clock. It has been proposed that NOCT deadenylates and regulates metabolic enzyme mRNAs. However, our lab showed that purified NOCT lacks the deadenylase activity. There are 3 major findings in this project: (1) NOCT is not compatible with RNA cleavage; (2) NOCT specifically and directly converts the dinucleotide NADP+ into NAD+, and NADPH into NADH; (3) NOCT is targeted to mitochondria. NADP(H) regulation, which takes place at least in part in mitochondria, establishes the molecular link between circadian clock and metabolism.The second part of my thesis work focused on NADK2, which phosphorylates NAD+ to maintain the balance between NAD+ and NADP+ in mitochondria. There are 3 major findings in this project: (1) The structure of NADK2 reveals an interlocked loop which stabilizes dimerization. This loop is conserved in NADK2 and absent in the cytosolic NAD kinase, NADK; (2) Dimerization is necessary for the kinase activity of NADK2; (3) Unlike NADK, which forms dimer of dimers upon activation, NADK2 forms spontaneous dimers and exhibits altered cooperativity. These findings reveal divergence between NAD(H)/NADP(H) regulation by cytosolic and bacterial kinases versus mitochondrial kinase, opening a unique new aspect of mitochondrial metabolism.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aBiochemistry. 4aMolecular biology. 4aBiophysics.  aNAD kinase 2  aNADP(H)  aNocturnin  a0487  a0786  a030720aPrinceton University.bMolecular Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872128503137nam a2200433   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002500131245006200156260005800218300001100276500007800287500003100365502004800396506005900444520047700503520127500980590002302255650002502278650001302303650002502316653001202341653002002353653000802373653001802381690000902399690000902408690000902417710003602426773005102462790000902513791001002522792000902532793001202541856015002553AAI2872131020220920004349.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108691  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721310  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aPallegar, Preethi N.10aSymmetries and Large N Limits of Majorana Fermion Models. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a170 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Klebanov, Igor R.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aIn this thesis, we study generalizations of well-known Majorana fermion models, including the SYK model and the Klebanov-Tarnopolsky tensor model. The models are compared at finite and large N, where we find that the models simplify considerably and can even become solvable. In chapter 2, we study quantum mechanical models in which the dynamical degrees of freedom are real fermionic tensors of rank five and higher. For the tensors of rank five, there is a unique O(N).  a5 symmetric sixth-order Hamiltonian leading to a solvable large N limit dominated by the melonic diagrams. We solve the large N Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations for higher rank Majorana tensor models and show that they match those of the corresponding SYK models exactly. In chapter 3, we study a family of tensor models of complex fermions, with a six fermion interaction whose index structure resembles the topology of a prism. The model is dominated by melonic diagrams in the large N limit after introducing an auxiliary field. We consider interactions that preserve the U(1) global symmetry, solving the SD equations at large N and examining the bilinear spectrum. We find a complex scaling dimension in the U(1) charged sector in addition to an O(1) gap between the ground and first excited states. This model has a negative charge compressibility. In chapter 4, we present a class of Hamiltonians H for which a sector of the Hilbert space invariant under a Lie group G, which is not a symmetry of H, possesses the essential properties of many-body scar states. These include the absence of thermalization and the 'revivals' of special initial states. Our study of an extended 2D tJU model illustrates the properties of the invariant scars and supports our findings.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aTheoretical physics. 4aPhysics. 4aApplied mathematics.  aAdS/CFT  aMany body scars  aSYK  aTensor models  a0753  a0605  a036420aPrinceton University.bPhysics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872131003447nam a2200361   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001500131245006600146260005800212300001100270500007800281500003000359502004800389506005900437520218100496590002302677650002202700653002802722653002602750653001402776690000902790710004502799773005102844790000902895791001002904792000902914793001202923856015002935AAI2872132020220920004349.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108608  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721320  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMa, Fermi.10aQuantum Security and Fiat-Shamir for Cryptographic Protocols. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a336 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Zhandry, Mark L.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis thesis presents new results on the security of cryptographic protocols in the quantum setting and the Fiat-Shamir heuristic for removing interaction.- Quantum Rewinding. Many cryptosystems are proven secure by rewinding an interactive adversary to extract its responses across multiple invocations. Unfortunately, this technique only suffices for classical security, since recording the outputs of a quantum adversary may irreversibly damage its state. Obtaining a suitable quantum analogue of rewinding has been a long-standing open problem in post-quantum cryptography.We give a general-purpose quantum rewinding procedure capable of extracting an unlimited number of responses from any quantum adversary; prior techniques were limited to a constant number. Our primary application is to prove that Kilian's succinct argument system for NP is post-quantum secure.- Quantum Secure Computation from One-Way Functions. Our second result concerns multi-party computation, a central primitive in cryptography that enables mutually distrusting parties to compute a shared function over their inputs while revealing no other information. We show that when all parties are quantum, secure multi-party computation can be based solely on the existence of the minimal cryptographic primitive: one-way functions. This is in stark contrast to the classical setting where such an implication is not known, and is considered unlikely.- The Security of Fiat-Shamir. The final part of this thesis investigates the soundness of the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, a powerful technique that uses a cryptographic hash function to remove interaction from certain cryptographic protocols. We consider two popular applications of Fiat-Shamir: building non-interactive succinct arguments from Kilian's protocol and obtaining digital signatures from a wide range of identification protocols. We demonstrate significant barriers to soundly instantiating Fiat-Shamir for Kilian's succinct arguments using any concrete Fiat-Shamir hash function. Our final set of results raises the possibility that natural identification protocols can be compiled with simple, non-cryptographic Fiat-Shamir hash functions.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aComputer science.  aCryptographic protocols  aFiat-Shamir heuristic  aRewinding  a098420aPrinceton University.bComputer Science.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872132003705nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001400131245009900145260005800244300001100302500007800313500003100391502004800422506005900470520232200529590002302851650001302874653001702887653003502904653001602939653001402955653001402969653001302983690000902996710006103005773005103066790000903117791001003126792000903136793001203145856015003157AAI2872136320220920004349.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108714  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721363  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMu, Tong.14aThe Ecology and Conservation of Migratory Shorebirds Along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a157 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Wilcove, David S.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aInvestigating the factors shaping the diversified patterns of habitat use and long-distance movements of migratory species is not only fundamental to understanding the ecology and evolution of migration, but also has direct conservation implications to more effectively preserving globally declining migrant populations. In my dissertation, I used coastal shorebirds as the focal species, and investigated how an ecological understanding in their habitat preferences, habitat quality, as well as migratory movement and migration strategies may inform conservation practices for these rapidly declining species at different scales.In Chapter 1, I quantified the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of local shorebird populations, and found that the upper tidal flats provided more than 70% of the cumulative foraging time for most shorebird populations, disproportionately greater than the size of this stretch of tidal flat. The results could explain why the population decline rates of many shorebird species have far exceeded the overall rate of tidal habitat loss, highlighting the importance of protecting upper tidal flats for the conservation of migratory shorebirds.In Chapter 2, I devised an entirely field-based approach to quantitatively evaluate the quality of a major stopover site for the declining Red Knot. I estimated that the Nanpu tidal flat was operating below, but remarkably close to, its carrying capacity. This approach needs to be applied more broadly to more accurately evaluate how the Red Knot population may respond to changes in habitat quality.In Chapters 3 and 4, I tracked the annual migration of two small shorebird species, Red-necked Stint and Red-necked Phalaropes, using light-level geolocators. Tracking the annual movement of migratory species not only sheds light on the species-specific migration patterns, but also contributes to understanding the factors shaping migration strategies and the vulnerability of these strategies to different anthropogenic threats.Taken together, this dissertation investigated some of the key ecological questions regarding the migration and stopover ecology of migratory, with direct conservation implications in identifying the factors that affect the vulnerability of migratory species to various anthropogenic threats at different scales.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aEcology.  aConservation  aEast Asian-Australasian flyway  aHabitat use  aMigration  aShorebird  aStopover  a032920aPrinceton University.bEcology and Evolutionary Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872136303476nam a2200373   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002200131245008400153260005800237300001100295500007800306500003200384502004800416506006900464506005900533520209000592590002302682650002302705653003702728653001302765653003602778690000902814710003802823773005102861790000902912791001002921792000902931793001202940856015002952AAI2872138020220920004349.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108585  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721380  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aRoos, Casey Bard.10aStrategies for Asymmetric Catalysis Utilizing Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a229 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Knowles, Robert R.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aRadicals are often considered high energy and fleeting intermediates. Controlling the reactivity of these species remains an outstanding challenge in catalysis. This thesis is centered around the use of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) as a strategy to control selectivity in both bond forming and breaking processes involving high energy radical intermediates. PCET is an elementary step that describes the homolysis of an E−H bond through the simultaneous movement of a proton and electron to a structurally distinct base and oxidant, respectively. This enables the activation of strong E–H bonds, such as alcohols and amides for which no sufficient single hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalyst exists.In the first part of this thesis, PCET is utilized to develop an enantioselective hydroamination of alkenes by sulfonamides. The enantioselectivity observed in this reaction is a result of a key post-PCET hydrogen bonding interaction between the generated amidyl radical and resulting chiral conjugate acid. Catalyst design, scope studies, and preliminary mechanistic results will be described herein.While the first section of this thesis is dedicated to the use of PCET-generated radicals for enantioselective bond formation, the latter half of this work describes the utility of these radicals for destroying stereochemistry towards the development of a dynamic kinetic resolution of remote stereocenters and small molecule deracemization. In the former, racemization of a remote stereocenter, a traditionally challenging process, is facilitated by the generation of an amidyl radical via PCET and subsequent 1,5-HAT to generate an achiral radical intermediate. Finally, preliminary results for a light-driven deracemization protocol are reported, utilizing a thiyl radical HAT catalyst to generate a captodatively stabilized radical which then undergoes reduction and enantioselective protonation. These projects illustrate the use of PCET to generate high energy species which can then be utilized to facilitate challenging bond breaking and bond forming processes.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aOrganic chemistry.  aProton-coupled electron transfer  aRadicals  aEnantioselective hydroamination  a049020aPrinceton University.bChemistry.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872138004134nam a2200493   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002200131245007000153260005800223300001100281500007800292500003400370502004800404506005900452520254100511590002303052650001803075650002003093650002203113650002103135650002203156653002903178653002603207653001203233653002803245653001403273653001603287690000903303690000903312690000903321690000903330690000903339710005103348773005103399790000903450791001003459792000903469793001203478856015003490AAI2872138220220920004350.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108745  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721382  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aHakobyan, Hayk L.10aRadiative Magnetic Reconnection in Compact Astrophysical Objects. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a159 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Spitkovsky, Anatoly.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aIn the magnetospheres of neutron stars, as well as in accretion disk coronae and black hole jets, energy is mainly stored in the form of a magnetic field. We observe these objects in a wide range of frequencies, from radio to TeV, and their typically high luminosities suggest that a considerable fraction of the magnetic energy is extracted via magnetic reconnection and converted into the observed radiation. In certain objects the energies are so extreme that the emitted light can backreact on plasma via quantum electrodynamic (QED) processes, significantly altering the dynamics of reconnection. This thesis is focused on studying how exactly reconnection operates in these extreme environments. Because of the complexity of these systems, we typically study their dynamics numerically. In the first chapter of my thesis I describe novel numerical algorithms to model self-consistently the interaction between plasma and light in the ultra-relativistic regime. In particular, I present techniques that allow the inclusion of QED processes, such as radiation reaction, Compton scattering, and pair-production/-annihilation in plasma simulations. In the next chapter I describe the physics behind the new particle acceleration mechanism discovered during numerical simulations of reconnecting current sheets. This mechanism allows the maximum energy barrier in reconnection to be overcome by slowly accelerating particles in continuously compressing magnetic islands, which were previously thought to be unimportant in this context. These results potentially explain the broken power-law radiation spectrum observed in some blazars. I then present global simulations of neutron star magnetospheres and study the 3D reconnection dynamics responsible for tapping the large magnetic-field energies in these objects. I demonstrate how microscopic plasma instabilities onset and evolve in large-scale reconnecting current layers in the magnetospheres of young energetic pulsars, and how the gamma-ray emission emerges from this process. This emission is so abundant and energetic that it can produce matter (pair plasma) which is fed back to the magnetosphere and strongly modifies the reconnection process. In the final chapter I study this effect from first principles in localized simulations. I demonstrate that this pair-production process has a negative feedback on reconnection, reducing its particle acceleration efficiency. This effect explains the observed universality of the high-energy cutoff frequency in gamma-ray pulsars.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aAstrophysics. 4aPlasma physics. 4aElectromagnetics. 4aQuantum physics. 4aParticle physics.  aHigh energy astrophysics  aMagnetic reconnection  aPulsars  aQuantum electrodynamics  aRadiation  aSimulations  a0596  a0759  a0599  a0798  a060720aPrinceton University.bAstrophysical Sciences.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872138203616nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001600131245005800147260005800205300001100263500007800274500002900352502004800381506005900429520228500488590002302773650002302796650001502819653001102834653002202845653002202867690000902889690000902898690000902907710006102916773005102977790000903028791001003037792000903047793001203056856015003068AAI2872144220220920004350.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108547  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721442  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aZhao, Qing.10aEssays on the Political Economy of Education Finance. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a193 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Rouse, Cecilia.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aLocal government spending on K-12 public education typically comprises almost half of total spending on K-12 public education in the United States.  Local governments typically rely on funds from property tax levies to finance the yearly operating budget for local public schools in their district.  These property taxes are often the outcome of a process that is political in nature, since local tax levies may be subject to a voter referendum.  This dissertation gives new contributions to the study of these voter referenda and their implications for public finance using both theoretical and empirical approaches.In an economic downtown, the question of how local funding for schools responds to losses in state aid and disposable income becomes even more pressing.  Using an agenda setter model with uncertainty over voter turnout, I develop a systematic approach to analyzing the effects of income and grant aid changes on local property tax levies, overall funding for schools, and the probability of referenda passing.  The analysis uses certain properties of indifference curves for normal goods.  I also show that budget-maximizing school boards in homogeneous districts choose budget proposals that have high rates of voter support.The empirical chapter provides an investigation of the outcomes of New Jersey K-12 public school budget referenda.  For failed budget proposals, school budget cuts are determined by local governing bodies whose decisions are not specified by law.  Using a unique compilation of voting, demographic, and school finance data including school budget proposals and outcomes, this study tests and supports the hypothesis that local governing bodies choose larger reductions for those budget proposals that are larger and more unpopular.  Additionally, I analyze the voter support for the referendum and test whether larger proposed tax levies are associated with higher levels of voter opposition.  I find that the effect of a larger proposal on the level of voter opposition depends on the circumstances that surround the larger proposal, and I propose two theories that explain the different effects.  Furthermore, I find that the level of educational attainment of a district is an important predictor for school budget referendum success.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aEducation finance. 4aEducation.  aEssays  aPolitical economy  aEducation finance  a0501  a0277  a051520aPrinceton University.bPublic and International Affairs.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872144202332nam a2200469   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100003500131245005900166260005800225300001100283500007800294500002800372502004800400506006900448506005900517520079000576590002301366650001601389650002301405650002301428653001401451653002401465653001001489653001301499653001001512653001301522653002201535690000901557690000901566690000901575710003701584773005101621790000901672791001001681792000901691793001201700856015001712AAI2872146720220920004350.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487745  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721467  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aWalling, Ian Michael Hamilton.10aPower and Vulnerability: Plato’s Gorgias in Context. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a196 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Lane, Melissa.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation argues that the central theme of Plato’s Gorgias is the relationship between power and the good life. By examining the connections of Plato’s Gorgias with the writings of the historical sophist Gorgias of Leontini, and by developing a novel account of Plato’s approach to social criticism it generates new interpretations of the treatment of rhetoric, power, and the good in the dialogue. I show that the core error of the arguments presented by Gorgias, Polus, and Callicles was to conflate a controlling form of power with the ability to advance our real interests.

With the most basic properties of neutrinos still not well understood, the neutrino sector may harbor yet undiscovered physics beyond the standard model of particle physics. In Chapter 2 we develop a new physics model in which neutrinos with mass self-interact in the early universe. Constraining this new physics with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large scale structure (LSS) measurements, we find a novel cosmological model with preference for strong neutrino self-interactions that is statistically distinct from the standard cosmological model, ΛCDM, and fits observations well. Beyond offering a good fit to CMB and LSS measurements, this novel model offers a potential solution for simultaneously solving the Hubble constant and matter clustering tensions. In Chapter 3 we further investigate the data components driving this preference and find that stringent small-scale CMB measurements should be able to either destroy or prefer this novel model. In Chapter 4 we update constraints on the novel self-interacting neutrino model with ACT CMB measurements, which possess superior small-scale measurements to previous experiments. Intriguingly, we find stronger preference for the novel cosmological model than before, primarily driven by CMB polarization measurements at moderate scales, rather than small scales. The preference and longevity of this radically different cosmological model sets a precedent for thoroughly exploring new models to explain the evolution of the Universe. Beyond exploring physics beyond the standard model, it is imperative to fervently investigate the mysterious vast swaths of nothingness, cosmic voids. As the largest objects in our Universe, these giants can span over 100 million light years across. Despite their massive size, they remain relatively unexplored and underutilized. In Chapter 5 we explain the utility of cosmic voids in constraining cosmological models. In Chapter 6 we illustrate the sensitivity of galaxies within voids to the sum of neutrino masses. We further the exploration of how void properties are sensitive to the sum of neutrino masses in Chapter 7. In Chapter 8 we discuss the machine learning simulations used to build the GIGANTES void simulation suite, presented in Chapter 9, which contains over 1 billion cosmic voids and over 20 terabytes of data. With these simulations, we prove that voids offer unique cosmological information to galaxies. We show that cosmic voids should yield an independent measurement of the sum of neutrino mass from future large scale surveys like DESI, Euclid, SPHEREx, and the Roman Space Telescope. Finally, in Chapter 10 we leverage the GIGANTES suite to develop a new interpretable pooling operation for leveraging cosmic voids to constrain cosmological parameters. The Universe hosts mysteries from the smallest to the largest scales, and this work aims to begin unraveling them.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aAstrophysics. 4aAstronomy. 4aParticle physics.  aCosmic microwave background  aCosmology  aLarge scale structure  aMachine learning  aNeutrinos  aSimulations  a0596  a0606  a079820aPrinceton University.bAstrophysical Sciences.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872146903012nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002900131245007900160260005800239300001100297500007800308500003200386502004800418506005900466520155400525590002302079650002202102650002902124653001702153653001402170653000902184653002802193653002702221653000902248690000902257690000902266710007402275773005102349790000902400791001002409792000902419793001202428856015002440AAI2872148320220920004351.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487974  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721483  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aHervieux-Moore, Zachary.10aModern Reinforcement Learning Techniques to Deal with Large Action Spaces. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a154 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Kornhauser, Alain.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aWhen developing reinforcement learning algorithms, the main issues are dealing with large state spaces and action spaces. For the most part, the state space complexity problem was solved with the advent of AlphaZero. AlphaZero is able to deal with unfathomably large state spaces by using a combination of neural networks and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). However, dealing with large action spaces remain an active area of research.We generalize the AlphaZero algorithm by introducing the GAIL framework and test a variety of alterations. We find that using Thompson Sampling as a selection procedure during the MCTS could potentially improve upon AlphaZero in two-player zero-sum games. However, AlphaZero is extremely competitive with all variations.We then show the strength of GAIL by applying it to the game of Scrabble which AlphaZero cannot be applied to due to its extremely large action space. Furthermore, GAIL coupled with the Upper Confidence Bound selection procedure and information set MCTS proves to be state of the art in the game of Scrabble. This also establishes that using information set MCTS can be used with a neural network value estimator in reinforcement learning.Finally, we extend these results to the continuous action space domain by developing ROAR. A novel algorithm that drastically lowers the action space complexity by making a finite number of action recommendations based on state context and historical performance via reinforcement learning. We end by successfully training it in a nontrivial robot problem.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aComputer science. 4aArtificial intelligence.  aAction space  aAlphaZero  aGAIL  aMonte Carlo tree search  aReinforcement learning  aRORY  a0984  a080020aPrinceton University.bOperations Research and Financial Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872148304114nam a2200505   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002900131245013000160260005800290300001100348500007800359500003900437502004800476506005900524520239800583590002302981650002603004650002703030650001603057650002703073650002003100653001903120653002203139653001903161653002203180653002303202653002703225690000903252690000903261690000903270690000903279690000903288690000903297710006103306773005103367790000903418791001003427792000903437793001203446856015003458AAI2872153920220920004351.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487837  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721539  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aRaghuraman, Shiv Priyam.10aChanges in the Satellite-Observed Radiation Budget: Manifestations of Radiative Forcing, Feedbacks, and Internal Variability. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a180 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Ramaswamy, Venkatachalam.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aEarth’s radiation budget is a fundamental indicator of the state of the climate. Satellite observations over 2000-2020 display significant monthly-to-decadal changes in the clear-sky greenhouse effect and outgoing longwave (LW) radiation (OLR). Radiative transfer experiments show that these OLR changes are driven by surface and atmospheric temperature increases (decreases) that are only partially offset by the accompanying water vapor increases (decreases). Water vapor in the middle troposphere, in addition to the upper troposphere, substantially contributes to the OLR changes. In addition to OLR changes, the observed net radiative imbalance displays a significant positive trend. Using climate model simulations, we show that it is exceptionally unlikely (< 1% probability) that this trend can be explained by internal variability alone. The trend is driven by a large decrease in reflected shortwave (SW) radiation and a small OLR increase. Model experiments show that this is because recent changes in effective radiative forcing and feedbacks are additive in the SW, while being nearly offset by each other in the LW.The SW forcing, dominated by cloud changes induced by rapid adjustment to greenhouse gas increases and aerosol decreases, helps explain the positive trend (heating) in the SW cloud radiative effect (CRE). LW greenhouse gas forcing decreases OLR more in clear skies than all-sky conditions because clouds mask the impact of greenhouse gas increases. This cloud masking helps explain the negative trend (cooling) in LWCRE. In contrast to the well-identifiable forcing contributions to CRE, cloud feedback contributions have a wide range. In fact, their signs are uncertain.To further understand the LW changes over this period, we investigate the changes across the LW spectrum. The observed spectrum displays significant OLR decreases in the CO2, O3, CH4, and N2O absorption bands as well as OLR increases in the H2O rotational, vibrational, and window bands. Line-by-line radiative transfer calculations and model simulations show that increases in well-mixed greenhouse gases caused an instantaneous radiative forcing and stratospheric cooling that decreased OLR, while the climate response, comprising temperature and humidity changes, increased OLR. We conclude that the satellite radiation record provides clear evidence of a human-influenced climate system.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aAtmospheric sciences. 4aEnvironmental science. 4aGeophysics. 4aPhysical oceanography. 4aClimate change.  aClimate change  aClimate feedbacks  aClimate models  aRadiative forcing  aRadiative transfer  aSatellite observations  a0725  a0768  a0467  a0415  a0404  a037320aPrinceton University.bAtmospheric and Oceanic Sciences.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872153904078nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002000131245008000151260005800231300001100289500007800300500002900378502004800407506005900455520263400514590002303148650001903171650002003190653002603210653002703236653003203263653002503295653002603320690000903346690000903355710006303364773005103427790000903478791001003487792000903497793001203506856015003518AAI2872158220220920004351.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487851  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721582  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aBass, Andrew J.10aHigh-Dimensional Methods to Model Biological Signal in Genome-Wide Studies. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a162 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Storey, John D.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aRecent advancements in sequencing technology have substantially increased the quality and quantity of data in genomics, presenting novel analytical challenges for biological discovery. In particular, foundational ideas developed in statistics over the past century are not easily extended to these high-dimensional datasets. Therefore, creating novel methodologies to analyze this data is a key challenge faced in statistics, and more generally, biology and computational science.Here I focus on building statistical methods for genome-wide analysis that are statistically rigorous, computationally fast, and easy to implement. In particular, I develop four methods that improve statistical inference of high-dimensional biological data. The first focuses on differential expression analysis where I extend the optimal discovery procedure (ODP) to complex study designs and RNA-seq studies. I find that the extended ODP leverages shared biological signal to substantially improve the statistical power compared to other commonly used testing procedures. The second aims to model the functional relationship between sequencing depth and statistical power in RNA-seq differential expression studies. The resulting model, superSeq, accurately predicts the improvement in statistical power when sequencing additional reads in a completed study. Thus superSeq can guide researchers in choosing a sufficient sequencing depth to maximize statistical power while avoiding unnecessary sequencing costs.The third method estimates the posterior distribution of false discovery rate (FDR) quantities, such as local FDRs and q-values, using a Bayesian nonparametric approach. Specifically, I implement an approximation to these posterior distributions that is scalable to genome-wide datasets using variational inference. These estimated posterior distributions are informative in a significance analysis as they capture the uncertainty of FDR quantities in reported results.Finally, I develop a likelihood-based approach to estimating unobserved population structure on the canonical parameter scale. I demonstrate that this framework can flexibly capture arbitrary structure and provide accurate allele frequency estimates while being computationally fast for large population genetic studies. Therefore, this framework is useful for many applications in population genetics, such as accounting for structure in the genome-wide association testing procedure GCATest.Collectively, these four methods address problems typically encountered in a biological analysis and can thus help improve downstream inferences in high-dimensional settings.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aBiostatistics. 4aBioinformatics.  aFalse discovery rates  aLatent variable models  aOptimal discovery procedure  aPopulation structure  aStatistical inference  a0308  a071520aPrinceton University.bQuantitative Computational Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872158203714nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002500131245010200156260005800258300001100316500007800327500003200405502004800437506005900485520228700544590002302831650002502854650002102879653003002900653002002930653002002950653002402970690000902994690000903003710006303012773005103075790000903126791001003135792000903145793001203154856015003166AAI2872158920220920004352.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487929  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721589  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aChu, Olivia Jessica.10aHeterogeneity in Human Populations, from Structure to Personality—A Modeling and Data Approach. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a182 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Tarnita, Corina E.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aIn human social systems, instances of heterogeneity abound. From the individuallevel to the population level, we see numerous examples of variation atdifferent scales of human organization. At the population level, there is heterogeneityin population structure: society is organized into groups, which determinewho meets and interacts with whom. These groups can be associated with family,school, jobs, hobbies, politics, and more. When we zoom in on these groups andconsider the interactions and dynamics that exist within them, we then see behavioralvariation and personality differences at the individual level: our behavior andpersonality can not only influence and be influenced by those we encounter, butit can also vary depending on social context. Taking a step back, we can also askhow groups even form in the first place, as well as how people assimilate into existinggroups. Individual-level heterogeneity in behavior can therefore affect groupson two levels: first, as groups form, and second, within existing groups. In thisdissertation, I explore heterogeneity at both the individual and population levels.I study dynamic changes in behaviors, opinions, and network structure using acombination of mathematical modeling, computational simulations, and empiricaldata collection and analysis. In the first chapter of this dissertation, I presenta model based on evolutionary set theory, in which individuals are distributedacross groups and imitate others based on their success. I explore how realisticgroup entry rules influence the evolution of cooperation in this model. In thesecond chapter, I investigate how individual-level heterogeneity in distinctivenesspreferences in social environments can lead to group formation using a model ofopinion dynamics. I also propose a complementary data collection study to evaluatehow groups form on university campuses and how students assimilate intocampus communities. In the third chapter, I bring together elements of individualand population-level heterogeneity to study the dynamics of polarization, usingsurvey data from before and after the Euromaidan Revolution of 2014. Overall,this dissertation aims to address a variety of questions concerning heterogeneityin human populations using modeling and data approaches.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aApplied mathematics. 4aSocial research.  aComplex adaptive networks  aSocial behavior  aSocial networks  aStochastic dynamics  a0364  a034420aPrinceton University.bQuantitative Computational Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872158903544nam a2200361   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001700131245012000148260005800268300001100326500007800337500004500415502004800460506005900508520219300567590002302760650002302783653002602806653002602832653001002858690000902868710006402877773005102941790000902992791001003001792000903011793001203020856015003032AAI2872160020220920004352.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108929  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721600  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aYue, Shuwen.10aThermodynamic and Transport Properties of Molecular Fluids: From Empirical Force Fields to Machine-Learning Models. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a155 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Panagiotopoulos, Athanassios Z.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aMolecular simulation predictions of thermodynamic and transport properties of fluids such as water, electrolyte solutions, and CO2 are of considerable interest to energy, environmental, and industrial applications. The reliability and accuracy of these predictions are contingent on the molecular models used in simulation. Here, we investigate the predictive capabilities of several classes of molecular models, from simple empirical force fields to high dimensional machine learning (ML) models, in order to provide insight on the necessary physics for representing complex fluids.We first evaluate empirically derived polarizable, non-polarizable, and scaled charge models in representing the dynamic properties of aqueous electrolyte solutions. While polarizability improves structural and dynamic predictions, there re- main insufficient physics for achieving quantitative accuracy. The advent of ML frameworks applied to molecular models has made way for far more descriptive representations of water and electrolyte solutions, combining ab initio levels of accuracy with classical level computational costs. However, the lack of explicit long-range interactions in ML models remains a fundamental caveat. We investigate the consequences of this localized representation for various thermodynamic regimes of water and electrolyte solutions. We then construct ML models based on the SCAN DFT functional for several species of alkali halide electrolyte solutions which give thermo- dynamic properties with excellent agreement with experiments and dynamic properties which significantly improve upon that of conventional empirical force fields. Finally, we constructed many-body polarizable models of CO2 and assessed the influence of functional form flexibility and training set quality on bulk thermodynamic properties.The results in this thesis illustrate the limitations and scope by which several classes of molecular models, from empirical force fields to ML models, can be utilized reliably. Additionally, new ML models of electrolyte solutions and CO2 constructed in this work provide promising avenues toward studying complex fluid behavior from first principles perspectives.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMolecular physics.  aElectrolyte solutions  aMolecular simulations  aWater  a060920aPrinceton University.bChemical and Biological Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872160003450nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002000131245006200151260005800213300001100271500007800282500003000360502004800390506005900438520209200497590002302589650002602612650002302638653001502661653002002676653001102696653002202707690000902729690000902738710006402747773005102811790000902862791001002871792000902881793001202890856015002902AAI2872163320220920004352.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108912  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721633  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aZhang, Wenxuan.10aMultiple Laser Beam Processes for Advanced Manufacturing. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a143 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Arnold, Craig B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aLasers are used in many material processes, including cutting, drilling, surface melting, and recently, additive manufacturing (AM). These processes use a laser beam, usually with a Gaussian intensity profile, to deliver energy to the desired locations. Currently, the productivity in AM is limited because a faster processing speed is often associated with more product defects and sometimes total failures. The highly localized energy input from a laser beam leads to instability during the melting and solidification process, especially at a high laser scan speed. Therefore, we explored ways to overcome such limitations---by adding another laser beam to provide additional control flexibility and increase manufacturing throughput.This thesis first examines two current AM techniques for metal products---powder bed fusion (PBF) and direct energy deposition (DED). While both methods produced acceptable samples, low throughput and product defects illustrated the limitations of systems with a single Gaussian beam. We then presented a self-built dual-laser set-up for PBF. By running the two laser beams in parallel, the system demonstrated that, besides increasing the throughput, a new regime characterized by periodic coalescence occurred between the two molten pools under certain processing conditions. Such a regime could benefit surface texturing in PBF. Using the same set-up but different spatial arrangements between the two laser beams, we revealed the fluid mechanics for the humping phenomenon, an instability commonly found in PBF with fast processing speed. We further linked this fundamental mechanism to the processing conditions to provide general guidance on avoiding the humping phenomenon.The last part of this thesis employs the dual-laser system to explore laser polishing, a common post-processing step to address the rough surface produced by AM. Our set-up effectively rearranged the laser beam energy from a Gaussian distribution into an elliptical beam, resulting in an elongated molten pool, and showed improved results compared to using a single beam.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aChemical engineering. 4aMaterials science.  aDual-laser  aLaser polishing  aLasers  aPowder bed fusion  a0542  a079420aPrinceton University.bChemical and Biological Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872163303793nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002300131245008100154260005800235300001100293500007800304500003000382502004800412506005900460520232500519590002302844650002102867650002102888653001602909653002102925653002502946653002702971653002502998653003803023690000903061690000903070710005103079773005103130790000903181791001003190792000903200793001203209856015003221AAI2872164820220920004353.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108950  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721648  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aKhan, Saeed Ahmed.10aNon-Equilibrium Quantum Dynamics of Nonlinear Multimode Circuit QED Systems. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a409 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Tureci, Hakan E.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architecture has been established as a highly-engineerable platform for the realization of multimode quantum nonlinear systems - necessary to harness the power of quantum computation and simulation, and for fundamental studies of many-body quantum optics. In this thesis, we provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the driven-dissipative dynamics of specific multimode quantum networks incorporating a single nonlinear element, realized in cQED by a Josephson junction. Using a stochastic description based on the positive-P representation, we analyze the dynamics of such networks across a well-defined classical-to-quantum transition. In the classical limit, we identify a specific symmetry requirement of the multimode networks - intimately tied to the dispersive nature of the Kerr-type nonlinearity furnished by the Josephson junction - which enables us to semi-analytically characterize their phase diagram for arbitrary network size. In regimes where the single nonlinear mode is sufficiently strongly-coupled to the network modes, the nature of their interaction becomes non-Markovian and fundamentally modifies the classical stability properties of the network. In particular, this interaction gives rise to classically unstable phases, where in addition to the possibility of chaotic dynamics, the network can undergo stable, periodic limit cycle excursions that display a frequency comb in the power spectrum. We analyze the impact of quantum fluctuations on these limit cycle dynamics as the system is brought to a quantum regime marked by a strengthening of the nonlinearity, and find that the linewidth of stable frequency combs is fundamentally limited by the vacuum fluctuations amplified by the very nonlinearity that generates the combs. Using a linearized Floquet analysis, we obtain an approximate analytic expression for the quantum-fluctuations-induced comb linewidths for multimode networks near the threshold of comb formation, an expression also verified using exact stochastic simulations. Our results and a recent experimental realization point towards multimode Kerr networks as a powerful cQED platform to study complex multimode dynamics of quantum nonlinear systems, and to generate engineerable, quantum-coherent multifrequency light sources.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aApplied physics. 4aQuantum physics.  aCircuit QED  aFloquet analysis  aKerr frequency combs  aNon-markovian dynamics  aQuantum limit cycles  aStochastic differential equations  a0215  a059920aPrinceton University.bElectrical Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872164803489nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002800131245007900159260005800238300001100296500007800307500003200385502004800417506006900465506005900534520195000593590002302543650002702566650001802593650002002611653002702631653002202658653001802680653001902698653001202717690000902729690000902738690000902747710004602756773005102802790000902853791001002862792000902872793001202881856015002893AAI2872171120220920004353.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108998  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721711  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aJaslove, Jacob Michael.10aRetinoic Acid Signaling and Transmural Pressure in Mouse Lung Development. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a132 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-04, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Nelson, Celeste M.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aDuring development, the mammalian lung undergoes several rounds of branching, the rate of which is tuned by the pressure of the fluid within the lumen of the lung. In this dissertation, we carried out bioinformatics analysis of RNA-sequencing of embryonic mouse lungs cultured under physiologic or sub-physiologic transmural pressure and identified transcription-factor binding motifs near genes whose expression changes in response to pressure. Surprisingly, we found retinoic acid (RA) receptor binding sites significantly overrepresented in the promoters and enhancers of pressure-responsive genes. Consistently, increasing luminal pressure activates RA signaling, and pharmacologically inhibiting RA signaling decreases airway epithelial branching and smooth muscle wrapping.Using both pharmacological and transgenic approaches, we found that pressure activates RA signaling through the mechanosensor Yap. Using a computational mechanical model we predicted that mechanical signaling through Yap and RA affects lung development by altering the balance between epithelial proliferation and smooth muscle wrapping around epithelial branches. We further predicted that increasing the rate of epithelial proliferation relative to smooth muscle differentiation would lead to dilated epithelial branches, which we confirmed experimentally. Finally, we found that in lungs from epithelial Yap knockout embryos, there is decreased smooth muscle wrapping relative to the rate of epithelial proliferation, suggesting that decreased smooth muscle differentiation downstream of disrupted RA signaling in these lungs is responsible for the dilated epithelial branches in these lungs. Our results show that transmural pressure signals through RA to balance the relative rates of epithelial growth and smooth muscle differentiation in the developing mouse lung and identify RA as a novel component in the mechanotransduction machinery of embryonic tissues.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aDevelopmental biology. 4aBiomechanics. 4aBioinformatics.  aComputational modeling  aMechanical stress  aMechanosensor  aMorphodynamics  aTension  a0758  a0648  a071520aPrinceton University.bMolecular Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-04B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872171104509nam a2200445   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002000131245009200151260005800243300001100301500007800312500003400390502004800424506005900472520299700531590002303528650001303551650002003564650001803584653001903602653002403621653001103645653002603656653002603682653001103708690000903719690000903728690000903737710007603746773005103822790000903873791001003882792000903892793001203901856015003913AAI2872175020220920004353.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108837  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721750  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aChien, Abraham.10aParticle Acceleration Due to Magnetic Reconnection Using Laser-Powered Capacitor Coils. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a232 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Ji, Hantao;Gao, Lan.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aMagnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous astrophysical process that rapidly converts magnetic energy into some combination of plasma flow energy, thermal energy, and non-thermal energetic particles, including energetic electrons. Various reconnection acceleration mechanisms in different low-β and collisionless environments have been proposed theoretically and studied numerically, including Fermi acceleration, betatron acceleration, parallel electric field acceleration along magnetic fields, and direct acceleration by the reconnection electric field. However, none of them have been heretofore confirmed experimentally in the laboratory, as the direct observation of non-thermal particle acceleration in laboratory experiments has been difficult due to short Debye lengths for in-situ measurements and short mean free paths for ex-situ measurements.Recently, laser-powered capacitor coils in high-energy-density (HED) plasmas have emerged as a new source for generating strong MegaGauss-level magnetic fields. These targets are comprised of two parallel copper plates connected by a coil. As high-power lasers irradiate the back plate, an electric potential is built, driving a strong current in the coil. Evolution of the coil current and its associated magnetic field is characterized as a function of laser parameters using ultrafast proton radiography and lumped-circuit modeling.We proceed to extend the platform to study magnetic reconnection by adding a parallel second coil, forming a reconnection geometry between the coils. We quantify electromagnetic field evolution in the reconnection region using ultrafast proton radiography and identify proton features corresponding to reconnection fields. We measure reconnection plasma parameters using Thomson scattering. Thus, we confirm low-β, magnetically driven reconnection is achieved in a quasi-axisymmetric geometry.Electron energy spectra, measured with a magnetic particle spectrometer, indicate accelerated non-thermal electrons from the reconnection process. These are manifested as spectral bumps with energies of 50 - 70 keV. The non-thermal electron spectra exhibit strong angular dependence, with a peaked signal aligned anti-parallel to the reconnection electric field direction and weakening with increasing pitch angle. 2-D, cylindrical particle-in-cell (PIC) reconnection simulations using the VPIC code demonstrate a formation of a non-thermal electron tail, with a similar angular dependence. These together indicate that the mechanism of direct electric field acceleration by the out-of-plane reconnection electric field is at work. Scaled energies using this mechanism show direct relevance to astrophysical observations where reconnection is hypothesized to play a role in accelerating electrons. Our results therefore validate one of the proposed acceleration mechanisms by reconnection, and establish a new approach to study reconnection particle acceleration with laboratory experiments in relevant regimes.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPhysics. 4aPlasma physics. 4aAstrophysics.  aCapacitor coil  aHigh energy density  aLasers  aMagnetic reconnection  aParticle acceleration  aPlasma  a0605  a0759  a059620aPrinceton University.bAstrophysical Sciences—Plasma Physics Program.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872175003239nam a2200433   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100003600131245008000167260005800247300001100305500007800316500005400394502004800448506006900496506005900565520167400624590002302298650003102321650001402352650002802366653002202394653003202416653003202448653001802480690000902498690000902507690000902516710003902525773005102564790000902615791001002624792000902634793001202643856015002655AAI2872176020220920004353.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471108684  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721760  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aRiis-Vestergaard, Michala Iben.10aTipsByText: A Parent-Oriented Language Intervention for Preschool Children. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a139 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: A.  aAdvisor: Haushofer, Johannes;Lew-Williams, Casey.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aEarly-life skills are a strong predictor of later life outcomes, and parents play an instrumental role in their children’s acquisition of early-life skills. However, there is still a question in the literature about the effectiveness of leveraging parents to improve children’s early-life skills as a large-scale policy tool. In this dissertation, we estimate the impact of a parent-oriented intervention, TipsByText, in a naturalistic setting with a large and diverse sample. TipsByText aims to increase language skills among preschool children by sending text messages directly to their parents with tips about how to incorporate simple language stimulation exercises into their everyday lives. To evaluate the effectiveness of the TipsByText intervention, we use data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in Denmark in 2019/2020 among 3,305 families with 3,804 three-to-five-year-old children. We estimate that the TipsByText intervention has a tightly estimated null effect on children’s language skills in the short run, indicating that the TipsByText intervention was not successful in improving language skills in our sample. We draw on various qualitative and quantitative data sources to analyze potential explanations for why the TipsByText intervention did not improve children’s language skills. As none of the available data sources provide us with a conclusive explanation for the lack of positive effect of the TipsByText intervention, a potential implication of the current study is that leveraging parents to improve children’s early-life skills might not be as effective as a large-scale policy tool as the literature suggests.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aEarly childhood education. 4aLanguage. 4aEducational technology.  aEarly-life skills  aParent-oriented inervention  aRandomized controlled trial  aText messages  a0518  a0679  a071020aPrinceton University.bPsychology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872176003413nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002400131245010900155260005800264300001100322500007800333500003200411502004800443506005900491520196800550590002302518650001302541650001802554650001502572653003202587653001702619653002302636653002802659690000902687690000902696690000902705710003602714773005102750790000902801791001002810792000902820793001202829856015002841AAI2872178220220920004354.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487967  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721782  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aBruno, Sarah Marie.10aFocal Plane Development for Observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background with the Simons Observatory. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a200 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Staggs, Suzanne T.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aA promising avenue for studying the origin and evolution of the universe is to measure the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the thermal radiation remaining from the Big Bang after billions of years of expansion. Today, this remnant takes the form of an extraordinarily uniform thermal blackbody of ∼2.7 K in temperature. Increasingly precise measurements of small fluctuations in CMB temperature and polarization have been instrumental in shaping modern understanding of the evolution of the early universe.The Simons Observatory (SO) is a new CMB experiment that will consist of several high-sensitivity polarization sensitive telescopes at ∼5200 m altitude in the Atacama Desert, Chile, observing in frequency bands between 27 GHz and 280 GHz. SO is designed to measure the temperature and polarization of the CMB to constrain cosmological parameters and detect evidence of primordial gravitational waves in the CMB polarization map. To accomplish these ambitious goals, the Simons Observatory must be built to provide unprecedented sensitivity, which requires cutting-edge, high-yield detector and readout technologies. The telescope focal planes are close-packed with Universal Focal Plane Modules (UFMs) at the 100 mK stage. UFMs are mechanically interchangeable assemblies containing stacks of 150-mm silicon wafers with detectors, optical coupling components, and readout components for microwave multiplexing (μMUX). SO will deploy a total of 49 UFMs with over 60,000 bolometers to achieve a multiplexing factor of approximately 1,000.This thesis presents my contributions to the early prototype UFM development, including the completion of sensitivity calculations used to inform design choices, the carrying out of assembly steps to maximize detector readout performance, the cryogenic testing of prototype components, and the development of a novel mathematical algorithm and device for simultaneous short checking for UFM electrical validation.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPhysics. 4aAstrophysics. 4aAstronomy.  aCosmic Microwave Background  aMultiplexing  aSimons Observatory  aTransition Edge Sensors  a0605  a0596  a060620aPrinceton University.bPhysics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872178203509nam a2200457   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100001900131245011200150260005800262300001100320500007800331500003300409502004800442506006900490506005900559520186000618590002302478650002302501650001802524650002002542653004802562653001202610653001002622653004102632653003802673653002602711690000902737690000902746690000902755710004602764773005102810790000902861791001002870792000902880793001202889856015002901AAI2872180820220920004354.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798460487790  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721808  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aPeng, Yingshi.10aProbing Translational Control During Drosophila Oogenesis: from Nanos to the Entire Maternal Transcriptome. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a123 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Gavis, Elizabeth R.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aTranslational control provides a key mechanism for the spatial and temporal regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. It plays a particularly important role in early embryonic development in organisms that rely heavily on maternally supplied mRNAs. The Drosophila developing oocyte serves as a valuable model for studying translational control. The Drosophila posterior determinant, nanos (nos), is translationally repressed throughout the oocyte cytoplasm except at the posterior pole. A multi-functional RNA-binding protein Glorund (Glo), the homolog of the mammalian hnRNP F/H family of proteins, represses translation of nos during oogenesis by targeting both translation initiation and translation elongation. To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which Glo regulates nos, I identified dFMRP as a Glo-interacting protein. By biochemically dissecting repression of nos translation in vitro, I demonstrated that dFMRP specifically inhibits translation elongation. Furthermore, I combined mutational analysis and in vivo and in vitro binding assays to show that Glo’s qRRM2 domain specifically and directly interacts with dFMRP, suggesting that Glo’s RNA-binding domains can also function as protein-protein interaction interfaces critical for its regulatory functions. Additionally, I applied ribosome footprint profiling to the Drosophila ovary at different developmental stages to identify maternal transcripts regulated during the translation elongation phase. A footprint peak-finding tool has been developed to detect transcriptome-wide ribosome stalling sites. My preliminary results suggest that developmentally regulated ribosome stalling sites may be widely present on Drosophila maternal transcripts. An A-/P-site mapping algorithm is currently under development to facilitate mechanistic analysis of ribosome stalling during oogenesis.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMolecular biology. 4aBiochemistry. 4aBioinformatics.  aFragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)  aGlorund  aNanos  aPost-transcriptional gene regulation  aTranslation elongation regulation  aTranslational control  a0307  a0487  a071520aPrinceton University.bMolecular Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872180806678nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002600131245009700157260005800254300001100312500007800323500005400401502004800455506005900503520519000562590002305752650002005775650002705795650002705822653002705849653002105876653001105897653001505908690000905923690000905932690000905941710006505950773005106015790000906066791001006075792000906085793001206094856015006106AAI2872186620220920004354.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471109872  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721866  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aPowis, Andrew Tasman.10aParticle Methods for Modeling Magnetospheric Diagnostics and Low-Temperature Plasma Physics. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a204 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Kaganovich, Igor D.;Shneider, Mikhail M.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aSingle-particle-motion codes trace the evolution of charged particles within applied electromagnetic fields. These numerical tools are widely applicable to study the evolution of six-dimensional phase-space distribution functions, with three space and three velocity dimensions. Coupled with grid based methods for solving the self-consistent electrostatic fields these techniques can be extended to study complex kinetic plasma phenomena through the particle-in-cell method. This thesis is broadly split into two components. The first sections of Chapter 1 details the applied mathematical aspects of single-particlemotion codes as well as the particle-in-cell method, and Chapters 2 through 4 apply these techniques to problems in magnetospheric physics and low-temperature plasmas. The second half of Chapter 1 and Chapter 5 discuss the development of a new particle-in-cell code to enable whole-device modeling of low-temperature plasma devices.In Chapter 2 a single-particle-motion code is applied to study the evolution of a proposed diagnostic for probing the Earth’s magnetosphere. Tracing magnetic field-lines of the Earth’s magnetic field using beams of relativistic electrons will open up new insights into space weather and magnetospheric physics. Analytic models and the single-particlemotion code are used to explore the dynamics of an electron beam emitted from an orbiting satellite and propagating until impact with the Earth. It is observed that the impact location of the beam on the upper atmosphere is strongly influenced by magnetospheric conditions, shifting up to several-degrees in latitude between different phases of a simulated solar storm. The beam density cross-section evolves due to cyclotron motion of the beam centroid and oscillations of the beam envelope. The impact density profile is ring shaped, with major radius ∼ 22 meters, given by the final cyclotron radius of the beam centroid, and ring thickness ∼ 2 meters given by the final beam envelope. Motion of the satellite may also act to spread the beam, however it will remain sufficiently focused for detection by ground-based optical and radio detectors. An array of such ground stations will be able to detect shifts in impact location of the beam, and thereby infer information regarding magnetospheric conditions.Chapter 3 applies a kinetic particle-in-cell code to investigate the formation of rotating spokes within a Penning discharge. This instability is commonly observed within E x B discharges, such as Hall thrusters or magnetrons, where it can lead to non-uniform and inefficient operation. Electron cross-field transport within the Penning discharge is highly anomalous and correlates strongly with the spoke phase. Similarity between collisional and collisionless simulations demonstrates that ionization is not necessary for spoke formation. Parameter scans with discharge current Id, applied magnetic field strength B and ion mass mi show that spoke frequency scales with √eErLn/mi, where Er is the radial electric field, Ln is the gradient length scale and e is the fundamental charge. This scaling suggests that the spoke may develop as a non-linear phase of the collisionless Simon-Hoh instability.Incoherent Thomson scattering is a non-intrusive laser diagnostic commonly used for measuring local plasma density. In Chapter 4, the same particle-in-cell code is applied to demonstrate that within low-density, low-temperature plasmas and for sufficient laser intensity, the laser may perturb the local electron density via the ponderomotive force, causing the diagnostic to become intrusive and leading to erroneous results. These results support predictions offered in a recent theoretical paper.The second part of Chapter 1 introduces some of the computational challenges associated with obtaining performance with a particle-in-cell code on modern supercomputers. These include exposing on-node parallelism via memory sharing paradigms as well as acceleration with GPUs. The mixed particle-grid nature of the algorithm leads to a range of choices for parallelisation across multiple nodes, with the advantages and disadvantages of each method discussed. Chapter 5 justifies the development of a new particle-in-cell code (LTP-PIC), with a focus on capabilities relevant to whole device modeling of lowtemperature plasma devices. This new code is applied to directly study the effects discussed in Chapter 1, and how the multi-level hierarchy of memory and parallelism on modern supercomputers can be leveraged to achieve performance. The code is also benchmarked against six other international codes, and applied to model a simple three-dimensional extension of that in Chapter 3.Chapter 5 may leave the reader wondering what happens next? Indeed LTP-PIC is a work in progress, and while it is well tuned to take advantage of modern supercomputers, it requires additional features to be broadly applicable to a wide range of low-temperature plasma devices. It is the author’s intention to continue pursuing development of this software as a platform for innovation, industry collaboration and as an open-source tool for the low-temperature plasma community.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPlasma physics. 4aComputational physics. 4aAerospace engineering.  aLow-temperature plasma  aParticle-in-cell  aPlasma  aSimulation  a0759  a0216  a053820aPrinceton University.bMechanical and Aerospace Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:2872186603737nam a2200481   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088040001900112100002200131245009700153260005800250300001100308500007800319500002900397502004800426506006900474506005900543520213200602590002302734650001502757650001402772650002702786650002302813650002702836653001202863653001302875653002502888653001802913690000902931690000902940690000902949690000902958690000902967710003802976773005103014790000903065791001003074792000903084793001203093856015003105AAI2872189520220920004354.5220920s2021    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9798471109926  a(MiAaPQ)AAI28721895  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aSotoudeh, Ramina.14aThe Dynamics of Behavioral Adoption: Culture, Networks, Institutions, and the Social Genome. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2021  a180 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 83-05, Section: B.  aAdvisor: Conley, Dalton.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2021.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aHuman behavior is complex, embedded in social and cultural structures and influenced by human biology. Across three different but interrelated studies, this dissertation integrates epistemological approaches to why and how people and groups adopt behaviors. The studies in this dissertation reveal how 1) cultural, 2) institutional 3) network-based and 4) biological mechanisms interact and jointly shape adolescent risky behavior. Study I (co-authored with Dalton Conley and Kathleen Mullan Harris) identifies metagenomic effects among adolescents, finding that having peers with higher genetic propensity to smoke leads adolescents to smoke more. In doing so, it reconceptualizes the social environment to include not only the behaviors of one’s peers but their biologies as well. Study II assesses the relational consequences of institutional punishment and finds that smokers are more likely to cluster together in friendship networks when they attend schools that harshly punish smoking behavior. The extent to which clustering varies with punishment is moderated by one’s genetic propensity to smoke. Those with lower genetic propensity to smoke are more likely to exhibit clustering based on smoking behavior in higher punishment environments. Higher smoking homophily and the harshness with which one’s school punishes smoking are shown to be consequential for these adolescents’ adult health outcomes. Finally, Study III argues for more holistic approaches to the study of human behavior. It reasons that any given behavior is best understood as part of a broader ecology of potential behaviors. This intuition is used to uncover multiple configurations of behaviors among American middle and high school students. It assesses the extent to which institutional setting, friendships and family environments explain these modalities of behavior and show that outcomes for drug users are conditioned by how drug use is embedded in the broader behavioral ecology. Overall, the dissertation advances the development of an epistemologically integrated and multi-level approach to understanding behavioral complexity.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aSociology. 4aGenetics. 4aPhysical anthropology. 4aSocial psychology. 4aBehavioral psychology.  aCulture  aNetworks  aRelational sociology  aSociogenomics  a0626  a0369  a0327  a0451  a038420aPrinceton University.bSociology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg83-05B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2021  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:28721895
